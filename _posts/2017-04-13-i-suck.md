Going through my [old posts and essays](/archive), I realized, my writing was pretty terrible. <!-- more --> That is not a long time ago (5-6 years). There is plenty of evidence: incorrect punctuations, very long sentences and complex words where they don't make any sense. And I was seemingly a fan of ALL CAPS FOR IMPACT!!

I have improved but wouldn't think of myself as a good writer even now. Yes, I have plenty of interesting ideas, but expressing them clearly, is a task I haven't mastered yet. Rewriting your own work is something I've read to be a helpful exercise for writers to improve. Maybe I could try redo and edit my old writings as well. 

There are some stories and a (silly) [poem](/poem/2014/02/14/valentine/) in the [Writings section](/writings) now. I won an award in college, for the detective story ["Mystery"](/fiction/2014/09/06/mystery/). It remains one of the best things I've written, which is not saying much.  

One of the incomplete stories I have in my drafts is "The Wizard". It's a mashup between Avatar(the Airbender) and Prophet(comic), which I thought was a good idea a few years ago. I'll try writing some more of it and post, just as an exercise. 

If you haven't guessed, the idea is to keep writing even when you know you suck. A [wise man once said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN43sCyEanA): **"Sucking at something is the first step to becoming sorta good at something"**
