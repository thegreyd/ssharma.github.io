Nothing specific, just catching up.

## Blog
For the past few months, I have been trying to organize better. Part of the effort is exporting my tumblr blog posts, and other writings to a central place. Github Pages with Jekyll is convenient, so this is where my work will be aggregated. I have some short stories, and old articles which I will post here as well. 

## De-anonymizing myself
I used to be very cautious about revealing my identity on the Internet. After some realization, I feel that these are my opinions, and I stand by them; and I'd hate for someone to take me less seriously just because I wrote anonymously. Now there's a name and a photo of a real tangible person attached to my online identities. 

## My Github projects
I have worked on sharing most my code on Github, and provide clear description and build instructions on how to run the project. Adding some screenshots, or gif would be pretty cool.

## Notes
Taking notes and reflecting on things, is a highly productive activity. Also called [Reflection Learning](https://sites.google.com/site/reflection4learning/why-reflect).

>Reflection is a form of mental processing – like a form of thinking – that we use to fulfill a purpose or to achieve some anticipated outcome.  It is applied to relatively complicated or unstructured ideas for which there is not an obvious solution and is largely based on the further processing of knowledge and understanding and possibly emotions that we already possess 

This has been my primary motivation to keep blogging. I used to think that notes were a way to save knowledge for the future, which is true but not the point. The process of note-taking(or writing) itself makes you structure your thoughts. 

Continuing on this path of enlightenment, I have a "Wiki" folder, full of markdown files about all different things. Every file is a self-contained topic, which I can link from other wiki files as well. I use SublimeText to open the Wiki folder, then `Ctrl+P` to switch between files, `Ctrl+Shift+F` to search in all wiki files. It really is neat. 

I also searched for a local Wiki server that can serve Markdown files as web pages, and found [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), which works great!

## Reading 
The book I've yet to review is "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance" (still have to finish some last chapters though). I am currently reading (almost finished) "blink" by Malcolm Gladwell, which contains many short studies and stories on unconscious thinking; plenty of food for thought. My next book would be "Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I bought it from a yard sale, where the author's name looked familiar. I am 40 pages in and the story is very grim. 

While it's easy to start a new book, I've sometimes struggled to complete them. Many things are fighting for my attention, and I try to focus as best as I can. With organizing, hopefully I can focus more on the important things. 

That's all.
