What I like about Archer is his storytelling & the strong characters which were imminent in his best-sellers & which are clearly not lacking here. After penning successful individuals he comes up with a 5-book series set from 1920-2020 revolving around the life of Harry Clifton.


This first book in the series introduces us to the boy Clifton born in a middle class family in rural England. The story is about the boy having great potential and how the people around him strive to turn him into a great man. The period is 1920-1940 and the setting is authentic enough ;you can feel the effect of the first war on the commoners as another comes to dawn. As the story continues,things do not go as planned for Harry as he begins to realize that his fate, even his identity was altered by a stranger. The plot unfolds, with unexpected twists,you get to know the characters deeply, their perceptions,their dilemmas. As the war presents itself, Harry takes command of his life,and sees himself immediately landing in turmoil(ya..America). But there are some patches where you may feel some actions performed for no such foreseeable reason, just there to give surprise endings. But most of the times the author manages to amaze the reader, dropping dramatic snippets here and there which sure is commendable.


The book is gripping for sure; you would want to read straight till the end. The vintage setting may seem boring to some. So what you read is for strong characters, strong emotions & drama (that the book is brimming with). Has Archer penned another best seller?-Yes; will you read it?-Only Time Will Tell.ï»¿
