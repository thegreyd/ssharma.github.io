Reading news today, I stumbled upon a livestream of [People's Climate March](https://peoplesclimate.org) in Washington, on [DemocracyNow](https://www.democracynow.org/). It had all kinds of people from different communities describe why they think climate change is important, and how/why they were participating in climate activism. I had a sudden urge to travel to Washington and stand with these people; not only because I care about climate change, but because of this slight guilt of not doing my part.<!-- more -->

While I type this behind my computer as a software engineer, its hard to see a clear path for me to get actively involved in activism. I have this feeling about all my fellow programmers, and people working in scientific fields, to take action and get involved in movements like these. This is what [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_chomsky) calls ["The Responsibility of Intellectuals"](https://chomsky.info/19670223/), in his essay from 1967.

He writes, "IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies. This, at least, may seem enough of a truism to pass over without comment. Not so, however. For the modern intellectual, it is not at all obvious." 

This holds as true now, when it was written in 1967, when Chomsky was urging people to take action against Vietnam War. And climate change affects the whole planet. It's not only climate, today there's an ongoing war on science, on women's health, proliferating war and weapons. For me, it's become quite hard to not totally be consumed in a cloud of pessimism about the current state of humanity. But this is an opportunity, where taking action is the only way forward. We need more people than ever today, to push the scales in balance. While I talk and convince people around me, and donate to activist organizations, I hope to get more directly involved in the future. "Think globally Act locally".

P.S: Curiously, while I was typing this post Noam Chomsky appeared on the livestream, speaking about the disastrous attitude and policies of the current U.S. administration. Now I don't usually read Noam Chomsky's essays for lunch, and I admit not reading the full essay, (only remembering the phrase) until today. He is the beacon of hope and sanity which I look upon, in times like these.
