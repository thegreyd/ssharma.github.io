Today a honda city just swooped-overtook me from front, taking a sharp turn, hitting my front tire. i tried to give a flaming glance but no, the windows were covered in those black-reflecting-plastic-sheet. yeah, i drive a bicycle,so i might be not so noticeable/worth caring for, to the man behind the steering.the driver obliviously drove away. other than that, would have taken place a routine chain of events=shouting+swearing+fighting only if i would have been a normal city guy.

i cussed him and my fate indignantly.
what is the problem? am i too scared-cowardish to face him? i should have noted his vehicle no. or called my masculine friends(which i don't have) or at least called the people nearby. no. actually this is a typical situation in the city, and being a cyclist you can't expect a more appropriate behavior. if i pick up fights these often i might become a lawyer.

then why cant people drive properly? didn't their trainer teach them properly? or are they so self absorbed ,conceited, ignorant to look around them, restrain from crashing. do they have negligible amount of care or emotion or for that matter, fear, towards hurting their fellow citizens to overcome their thrill of speed. maybe they think that with owning a oomph vehicle comes a license to own the roads, pulverize the lesser creatures who are so miserable even to own/drive one. aren't they humane or even human.

why aren't they human when they believe in god, celebrate every festival with heights of exaggeration,have a respectable position in society and of course care for their dear ones.so if you would have done the same to them you'd be hell by now(of course they would've bribed yamraj!).

why should they bother when they live in a democracy-the ideal govt. anyway? . they have voted, paid tax and every other citizenry responsibility, what now you expect?. don't they have freedom to honk ear shattering horns at roads/signals, freedom to show-off ,every-other-freedom-you-can-think-of. there is central govt.-state govt-municipality-police, traffic policeman and hospital of course. even anna to do their bidding. why should they care?
i ask you reader, why???
