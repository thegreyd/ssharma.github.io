Traditions are those customs or a certain way of doing things which have been followed since our aboriginal times; unquestioned they keep sliding down to every generation. A very flamboyant example of a tradition is religion. We might say that in turn religions have their own traditions. Traditions can be good or bad ,pertaining to the present context. Why do we need human defined constraints that our idle ancestors devised to their comforts,in our lives; when we have much bigger problems at our forehand. Are they really constraints or are we bashing them just because they sound so outmoded-archaic? The answer to the question lies in our definition of “good” and “bad”.
                         
Modernization is progressing,being eclectic. New thoughts,ideas, which are pragmatic in every sense. We have been tending to do things which anyone would not have perceived before. Experimenting with our own selves ,with our surroundings, pushing boundaries,questioning everything. 

Then how do traditions fit in this Utopian world? Here's an example from my own family traditions:   
- It is considered bad if you clip your nails at night. You do tediously lengthy worship of your god by singing loud songs in an unusual throaty ranting voice(priests do that every time) which could easily scare a street dog. It is considered unfortunate if a cat crosses your path or someone sneezes when you are about to do something good. If your life is not easy going you might want to consider a priest who would suggest you wearing an enchanted pendant or a ring which will wipe all your worries.
- you should regularly fast 3-4 days in a month. During worship you are advised to do a ritual in which you lit a holy fire and burn in it pure butter. You donot wear outside slippers in the kitchen.

The 1st one you see is absolutely ludicrous. Think about the 2nd one. Ya.. all these things mentioned are scientific in nature. Fasting gives your digestive system a rest to clean up your body. By burning pure butter actually the immediate atmosphere is cleansed, it acts as anti-pollutant and effective pesticide. The last one is an hygienic essential.

So you see the discerning factor lies with us. A proper mix of both tradition and modernization can be the ultimate solution to live naturally and healthily.﻿
