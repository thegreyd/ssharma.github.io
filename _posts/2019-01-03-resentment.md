Emotions rule us, in every way. There are basic positive and negative emotions we recognize. Positive like happy, excited, loving and Negative like sad, angry, scared. When things go well we ride the positive emotional train. Choo Choo! And we see our mood spiral up, it's a cycle that feeds itself. But when shit is bad, they spiral the other way, like a vicious cycle. 

That's a basic introduction to emotions and I'm no expert on them. I can only hope to express the shit I've experienced. That's why I want to express my insight about a very specific emotion called Resentment. Google defines it as: "bitter indignation at having been treated unfairly". I'm sure everybody has felt resentful at some point in their life. It's a feeling of "I do not deserve this" or "This is not fair". It's anger highly-compressed and buried deep inside your soul which doesn't sit still but manifests in toxic ways. If not dealt properly, it will eat you from the inside.

One of the ways resentment grows is when you get bullied and you don't fight back. It's clenched fists and curse words that never manifest themselves. I don't consider myself an angry person and I rarely get angry. Wait that's not correct. I get angry but I rarely express my anger.. which is the point I'm trying to make. You need to find ways to express your anger and frustration right when you feel them. I used to believe (at a certain level even now) that getting into conflicts is a fools errand, that you rarely can change the outcome by getting in a conflict. My strategy to deal with every unfair treatment was to avoid conflicts and avoid that person altogether. Because they're stupid, they bother me and I'm can't do anything about it. 

Do you see the flaw in that? It's the survival strategy of a child dealing with tyrannical adults. They dictate everything you do, you don't get a say because your opinions are young and naive. But you do grow up and then it's anything but healthy for you. If you don't learn how to express your dissatisfactions, people will walk all over you. And it's not because they are evil but because they can't read your mind. People can rarely think beyond themselves to figure out the subtle cues of discomfort you're giving them to stop. Well some are evil who will dominate you just because they can. In both cases you need to have very clear boundaries and communicate them to people. It's a skill called assertiveness, a skill that my father didn't teach me (or any other teacher for that matter). It's usually seen as a masculine trait, disagreeing and standing up for yourself, which I guess people think is naturally present in boys. That isn't true. Ever heard of "Nice guys"? These are dudes lacking assertiveness. You can't trust a nice guy, like you cannot trust a resentful person. The anger ultimately manifests itself in passive aggressive ways.

And let me be clear, it's not bullies. There are far many opportunities of resentment in every close relationship you can have, including the ones you can't get out of. You can get rid of the bully, but you can't get rid of your parent or partner (if you feel that way you know it's time to repair them). Parent-child, husband-wives, siblings, best-friends can have unresolved issues lurking in the dark, never spoken about. Boundaries never discussed, angry feelings never expressed. Soon you will absolutely hate that person and torture them for what they did to you, until you reach a breaking point. That shit is the worst.

The other way you can be a resentful person is envy. When you envy what other people have that you don't have. Are you ugly, poor, short, bald, fat, unpopular, can't find a romantic partner? Feel like you were unfairly treated by life, like you were robbed of fine opportunities to live life to the fullest? Welcome to Resentment hell! Anytime you see a person who has what you don't have, you'll despise them. You wouldn't want to be friends with them. Their happiness will be a glaring reminder of your incapability. These bitter feelings are natural and I've felt them, I'm sure everybody has felt them at some point. This is a harder and more complex problem to solve, because life is unfair if you see it like that.

So how do you get out of this hole? How do you deal with resentment? 
- First, recognize that these thought patterns are not helping you. They are making you miserable. Ask yourself - The people who you felt oppressed by, would you want them to be unhappy? Are they evil?
- Second, learn to identify and acknowledge it. What are you resentful about from your past? Are you envious of something you don't have? Are all of your relationships built on truth and clear boundaries, and not on conflict aversion?
- Third, learn assertiveness, speak the truth and heal your past. Recognize that speaking the truth brings about the best version of reality.
- Fourth, stop before it grows. Resentment is a very sneaky emotion, it grows in the shadows. Learn to address when these feelings arise.
- Fifth, work on yourself in whatever way you can and work on your goals. Go to gym, lose weight, learn new skills etc. This will make you feel better about yourself and get you on track.
- Sixth, make a list of things that you're grateful for. Recognize that you're quite privileged actually.

Anyway this is all advice that I'm trying to give myself as much as to anyone else out there. Resentment is bitch. Get rid of it.
