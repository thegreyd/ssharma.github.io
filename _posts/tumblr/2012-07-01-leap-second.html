<p>This &rsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second" title="leap second | wikipedia" target="_blank">leap second</a>&rsquo; adjustment was first introduced in 1972, and have been used 24 times since then, and this was the 25thÂ occasion. Because the Earth&rsquo;s rotational speed varies, due to varying climatic and geological events; these adjustments keep international time close to accuracy.</p>
<p>Due to its weird nature, servers and online databases have a hard time dealing with it. Many websites crashed because of it, this time too. <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/07/leap-second-bug-wreaks-havoc-with-java-linux/" title="leap second bug wreaks havoc | Wired" target="_blank">Here is a Wired report of it.</a></p>
<p>Google has a really interesting blog post about &lsquo;leap second&rsquo;, its complications on technology and how it deals with it, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2011/09/time-technology-and-leaping-seconds.html" title="Time, technology and leaping seconds | Google Official Blog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
