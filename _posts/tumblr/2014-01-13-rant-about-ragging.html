<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the definition</p>
<p>Ragging: Make fun of (someone) in a loud, boisterous manner.</p>
<p>When in college, I was met with a dilemma, every college going kid faces. It was a ritual, an unmentioned one. It was a culture, a breeding ground for bullies. They were my seniors, staring at me like I was another worthless piece of shit, ready to be pummeled into a kid with an impaired sense of identity, left naked in a cold pool of embarrassment.</p>
<p>This was life. Life&rsquo;s unfair. It happened to them and one or two people can&rsquo;t stop it. The behavior must be perfectly normal. Now the same must happen to me. Or it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to them.</p>
<p>While I justify this to myself, I will continue doing so to my juniors. because now for me it&rsquo;s fun and why am I labelled bad for doing it, after I went through it. Look at me I am so confident and smug while abusing others! Actually I&rsquo;ll let you in a secret: This feeds my ego.. Hehe..</p>
<p>That is the mind of a Sadist.</p>
<p>Sadistic pleasure is the lowest kind of pleasure that has ever existed in society. From Tom and Jerry, to Professional Wrestling to Ragging in colleges, it has slowly creeped on to us, becoming an accepted part of everyday life, disguised, becoming a part of mainstream media. It exists for &ldquo;Shits and Giggles&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Does this take into account, how people are molded into becoming something evil. Mocking, insulting, publicly shaming, teasing, sexually abusing. These bullying tactics mar children, young students for life. They live in fear, paranoia, to not to again through that painful experience again.</p>
<p>Damaging young minds for life, seems like a lot of responsibility.</p>
<p>This is wrong. All of it.</p>
<p>If this is about College, and Juniors and Freshers, then I say this : You are not Superior to me. You do not demand respect. You earn it.</p>
