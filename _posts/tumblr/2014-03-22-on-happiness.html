<p>As biological creatures, we are hardcoded to have happiness as a key ingredient in being able to live longer and healthier. Our bodies, simply function better when we are happy, social, maintain a nurturing relationship with fellow beings. This might seem obvious, but it is very important to understand the distinction.</p>
<p>When you are happy, and with people, brain releases hormones, which is essential for proper physical functioning. When you are sad, depressed, your body also reacts negatively to your psychological state. This is a snowballing effect, which can fuck you up badly.</p>
<p>It essentially means that humans are creatures of groups. They exist and survive in groups. We aren&rsquo;t evolved enough to survive alone. This does explain how ideally we have notions of individuality and respecting individual freedom, but fail to achieve true autonomy.</p>
<p>More interesting is the use of drugs, to trick the mind, to get a high, a heightened sense of self and surroundings, to be able to increase productivity and performance.</p>
<p>As explored upon in many sci-fi utopias, I do look forward to advancements in science and technology, that can get us rid of this crippling dependency, and to beat depression. </p>
