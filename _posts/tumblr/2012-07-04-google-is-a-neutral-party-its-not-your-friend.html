<blockquote>Google is a neutral party — it’s not your friend, secretary or sister. It’s not your mom. It’s not your girlfriend or boyfriend. It is an information retrieval entity. You ask, we respond. And it’s very important that this entity be impartial, and adding jokes and other mannerisms to the voice would take away from that.</blockquote>&#8212;<strong>- Hugo Barra</strong> (<em>Android director</em>)
