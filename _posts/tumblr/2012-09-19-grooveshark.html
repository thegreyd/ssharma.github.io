<a href="http://html5.grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a><br/><p>Grooveshark(for your musical urges) has an html5 web app which looks and works really nice on mobile. It had its native apps from ios and android pulled off because of some legal trouble. </p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>I was surprised at first, seeing that it accepts songs(even, and more importantly, licensed) from users and let anyone stream them for free; whereas other services charge a fee(although minimal) and most are not availaible out of the US. But this isn&rsquo;t any different than listening the song on youtube, so don&rsquo;t know why should it matter in the first place; probably to support artists.</p>
<p><em>P.S. - It&rsquo;s <a href="http://grooveshark.com" target="_blank">desktop app</a> looks slick too, but apparently, requires Flash. </em></p>
