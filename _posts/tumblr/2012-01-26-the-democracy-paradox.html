<p>Today is 26th JANUARY 2012, the 63rd republic day of India. In the wake of the occasion, watching the parade, hovering in my mind are some things that remind me that we still have a long way to go. </p>
<p>                        There have been 2 instances in past few months that I think are worth noting. These have been-:</p>
<p>1) Proposition of censoring the internet by the govt. for objectionable content, esp. user created content on social networking and sharing sites(facebook, youtube etc.). </p>
<p>2) Salman Rushdie&rsquo;s failed attempt to attend the jaipur literature festival because of a death threat by some muslim groups. </p>
<p>This brings me to the conclusion that expressing free opinion in any kind of form(speech or in writing) in India is still not as free as some would have liked or as visioned in an ideal democracy.Why?</p>
<p>There is our right to protest, which can be marching on the roads chanting slogans or creating a facebook wall page in protest; both come under the same right, though the means being so different, they have the same goal. why does the govt. wants to take our right to protest on the internet, when at the same time burning an effigy of the pm(or any other notable political figure) is no real cause of concern for them? is it because they think that they may have a chance to control our online activity before it starts making some big difference offline and starts disrupting their political ambitions (like presently in other western countries)? i think so. </p>
<p>Salman Rushdie is a world renowned british-indian author who has won many awards including the booker prize and &ldquo;the best of bookers&rdquo; for his book. India is his homeland. He has written some objectionable and sensitive religious content in his book &ldquo;The Satanic Verses&rdquo;, which has been banned in the country. Because of it he is given a death threat and has to drop his plans of attending the Jaipur literature festival. The Rajasthan govt. should have taken the responsibility of his safe visit. Even the video conference of Q&amp;A session with him was cancelled. Many authors and fans were disappointed and expressed their dissatisfaction. I haven&rsquo;t read any of his books and also i have no hard feelings towards Muslim religion, but I still think that such a situation is very uncalled for and is most unsuited for a democracy.   </p>
<p>So (Obviously) people have different and contradicting opinions and we should respect them nonetheless. This is a lesson I think, we still have to learn.</p>
