<p>Some time ago, read this article (via <a href="http://hackerne.ws" title="Hacker News" target="_blank">HN</a>) : <a href="http://postmasculine.com/a-dust-over-india" target="_blank">http://postmasculine.com/a-dust-over-india</a> . The author(American) travels to India and is basically.. appalled by it. This was my original comment. </p>

<p><em>Hi Mark! That was an interesting read. I’m an Indian and 18yo and would like to share some thoughts with you. Yes, India is a great mess. All your arguments are valid. I think the core problems are the magnitude of population, and the extremist nature of religions.</em><br/><em>Due to a massive population, the quality(and value) of life has been worsened and it cannot be improved as long as population growth is not controlled. There are not enough resources. If ever, a western country, would have to deal with such a population density (or something close to it), I think, the cracks in it would become as glaring and obvious as they are now in India. There is simply no other way of saying it.</em><br/><em>Next is, the religions. The beggars and the people-with-shit-all-over-them are mostly who are born “low” into the society. In a western country, descrimination might be based on ethnicity, but in India it is a much more complex idea of cast, religion and community. There may be a thousand reasons to discriminate against somebody in India. And the discrimination, is itself etched in the religious teachings; a cast being inherently superior to some other; or a religion purer than some other. There are segregations at every level. These religions are at major fault.</em><br/><em>Some other things: People everywhere are bound by societal rules, but it is much more extreme in India. People here, are at no fault. They are born into a mess. We are taught and reminded at every aspect of life, to respect and unquestioningly follow the rules, values and norms of the family, the society, the community and the religion. The majority here never question these things! There is no logic! Just a set of instructions. The thought-provoking intellectual discussions are such a rarity, here. Everything is too shallow.</em><br/><em>Disclaimer: I was born a Brahmin, into a middle class family. Was (largely)ignored by parents; was fortunate to view and percieve the world with my own sense of understanding. I am an Atheist.</em></p>

<p>A large part of it still holds true, for me. Was reminded of it as i recently participated in a Group discussion, about democracy-corruption-economy(how they affect each other). I firmly believe that population control is absolutely necessary, for things to get better. China has its one-child-policy and India should have some strict measure like it. On the contrary, i know that, a one or two child policy won&rsquo;t ever(practically) be a reality in India; well&hellip;.<strong>Democracy</strong>.</p>
<p>So what about the future? Indians will be hard to ignore, no matter where you go. Migration rate of Indians to US, UK, Australia, Europe has been rising significantly. And these countries can&rsquo;t really prevent it, as majority of the populace is students ,supporting their institutions. So, most wind up getting a more-than-decent job there, and never move back.</p>
<p>To put it crudely, majority of the valuable human resource(well qualified, economically sound) in India, is moving somewhere else. What is left, is a country full of ancient political leaders, ruling the under-qualified/economically-unsound citizens. Ah.. almost forgot to add the religion and communal nonsense.</p>
<p>P.S. - <em>Now that i read it, the comment gives a hint of sensationalism and of hypocrisy. Never mind.</em></p>
