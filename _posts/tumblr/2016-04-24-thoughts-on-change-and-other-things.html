<p>I was visiting all the posts we&rsquo;ve written on this blog, and was thinking about things that I would&rsquo;ve changed. I feel quite differently about many things than my past self.<!-- more --> I have gained new information, and I have gained new perspectives that enables me to interpret old information in new ways. My views about Elon Musk have changed, and my views on religion and faith have changed. About the things that Richard Dawkins wrote, I feel differently now. </p><hr><p>As an engineering student studying computer science, surrounded by a smug geek culture, you never really are forced to expand your worldview. Silicon Valley is the Mecca for you, and Technology is the answer to all problems. Seldom you would hear somebody talking about political philosophy or economics or moral philosophy. I think of this about students of sciences in general. Science is the greatest tool of humanity. It has made us infinitely more capable to better our lives, and the lives of others. But it is important to recognize that science does not operate in a vacuum, and scientific progress is not a worthy goal in itself. Our society is governed by political and economical thoughts, which govern scientific progress and its applications in our society. These thoughts/ideologies which even today, have no objective rational justifications. It is equally(and probably more) important for the geeks to try and &ldquo;disrupt&rdquo; our economic, political and moral underpinnings, than it is to be part of the next billion dollar startup. </p><hr><p>Reading &ldquo;<a href="http://adventuresinthinking.tumblr.com/blog/2017/04/09/2015-06-16-qualia-and-other-obscurities">Qualia and other obscurities</a>&rdquo; by MrTsRex(great post if you’ve not read) I was taken to the youtube channel “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/obscuresorrows">The dictionary of obscure sorrows</a>”. A few videos forward, I was fascinated by the combination of beautiful visuals, subtle music, poetic dialogues spoken in a soft but firm voice. </p><p>The word <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNgyEmYyQF4">Zenosyne</a>, which means the sense that time keeps going faster. I know this is true in the physical sense, that a year when you are 18, is 1/18th of your total living memory, but only 1/50th when you are 50. Still, I don&rsquo;t think our brain stores memories as linearly as this simple probabilistic comparison tries to show. For example some years might be more vivid and eventful than others, regardless if it was at 50 or 18. And as I am now 22, my uneventful teenage years hold a lowly place in my memory in comparison to my more recent years and its more like 90% last 3-4 years and 10% other years.</p><p>The principle of &ldquo;Exponential growth&rdquo; better explains for what I&rsquo;ve experienced in the past few years. Human civilization has experienced an exponential growth(and will achieve a Technological Singularity if Ray Kurzweil is to be believed), in the sense that we&rsquo;ve progressed more in the last 50 years than the last 500 years.  If we translate it to our own lives it leads to something like: the new knowledge and experiences I&rsquo;ve gained leads me to be more productive, which in turn provides me more knowledge and experience. By this logic, your current state would be the best(by best I don&rsquo;t mean qualitative best but quantitative) you&rsquo;ve ever been in your whole life (congratulations!). Sadly, this may be true for our younger years, we do hit a plateau in the graph because *Spoiler Alert* we are humans and our bodies have limits. </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="347" data-orig-width="721"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/ca88aff5f729bf76488b5b0213c7d57c/tumblr_inline_o63wvsfOKN1r2fhqc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="347" data-orig-width="721"/></figure><p>The word <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBoZzArmtNA">Alazia</a>, expresses the sense that you&rsquo;re no longer able to change; as shown by the worldview curve in the graph. My personal experience affirms this that my beliefs, ideology and philosophy have refined over time, but the sense of direction has not changed dramatically. The magnitude of the mental breakthroughs which I achieve today, would be hard pressed to be challenged in the future.</p><p>It is frightening to think about this rigidity creeps into us. It makes me think what if my worldview is wrong, would I be able to know and (more importantly) consciously able to change? But when you do think calmly about it, the answer is easy. A worldview doesn&rsquo;t need to pick sides or be rooted in some ideology, it can very well be a simple one. To be correct, we just need to believe in some fundamental truths and values which won&rsquo;t change with time: </p><ul><li>The value of science and scientific truths.<br/></li><li>The egalitarian principle to treat every human being as equal, who have some basic rights such as liberty; </li><li>Our responsibilities to preserve the environment and the species that inhabit our planet with us. </li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s more growing wise with time to know that the things that come in the future, “the known-unknowns and unknown-unknowns”, might be vastly different than our imagination, but they will(or should) not violate some basic principles.</p>
