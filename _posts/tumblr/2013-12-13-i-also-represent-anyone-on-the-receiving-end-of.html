<blockquote>I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend<br/>
I&rsquo;m the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in<br/>
I&rsquo;m your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen<br/>
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin<br/>
Nope, it&rsquo;s hopeless, I&rsquo;m the denial that you&rsquo;re hopelessly in<br/>
When they say all of this is approaching its end<br/>
But you refuse to believe that it&rsquo;s over, here we go all over again<br/>
&hellip;<br/>
I am your lack of a conscience<br/>
I’m the ringing in your ears<br/>
I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils<br/>
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts<br/>
I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged<br/>
Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow<br/>
&hellip;<br/>
I&rsquo;m the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”<br/>
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow<br/>
I&rsquo;m the future that&rsquo;s here to show you what happens tomorrow<br/>
&hellip;</blockquote>&#8212;<p><em>Bad Guy - Eminem (MMLP2)</em></p>
<p>One of the best verses I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
