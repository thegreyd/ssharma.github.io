<p>Finished reading <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead" title="book - wikipedia" target="_blank">The Fountainhead</a> </em>by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand" title="author - wikipedia" target="_blank">Ayn Rand</a> and i am just blown away. The central idea and theme of the book is very strong, interesting and revealing (imo). I had been thinking much about it and things like these always concerned me. Things like : &ldquo;There is no such thing as free will&rdquo;.</p>
<p>How much portion of our lives do we truly own? I try experimenting and challenging and pushing the boundaries to get a sense of it. Are my decisions, my own? How much influence do people have on the course of my life and is it desirable? How can i prevent it? How can i become truly self sufficient? What things do i need to do?  What things do i want to do? There is an important distinction between &lsquo;need&rsquo; and 'want&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>I need to pay my tax</strong>. There doesn&rsquo;t seems to be a question of 'want&rsquo; here; it&rsquo;s a rule. What does it do? It gives me the <strong>freedom to be 'happy&rsquo;</strong>. <strong>That</strong> is my 'want&rsquo;. So is that a compromise? No. Because when you understand that doing this thing, in turn, gives access to your other 'wants&rsquo;, you then start wanting it. And if otherwise, that need has absolutely no relation with your want, then it&rsquo;s irrelevant. </p>
<p>Lets briefly review our social lives here. What makes us 'happy&rsquo;? Getting 'Likes&rsquo; or more 'Followers&rsquo; or more 'Karma&rsquo;? Do we live our life for others? That&rsquo;s so goddamn selfless. Congratulations! We all are public property(!?). Some time ago i saw, a movie, about a young guy, who abandons his 'career&rsquo; and family, becomes a hitchhiker; discovering and experiencing new things, is what he 'wants&rsquo; and 'likes&rsquo; to do and that&rsquo;s what he does. In the end of his solitary journey, he concludes something like this: Any accomplishment is not worthy if it can&rsquo;t be shared or if there isn&rsquo;t someone to appreciate it, because real happiness comes from that. </p>
<p> Ayn Rand&rsquo;s hero argues that true happiness should come only from the sole existence of the accomplishment at any point of time. So it&rsquo;s like a (public)blog post with zero page views. In this case, it is the result of your creative instincts, and that you wrote it because you wanted to; knowing that it existed at some point of time should be the real cause of 'happiness&rsquo;. Only then you are a 'selfish&rsquo; person and not a 'second-hander&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For some context : <a href="http://nasonart.com/personal/lifelessons/fountainhead.html" title="final speech from Fountainhead" target="_blank">Howard Roark&rsquo;s(the protagonist&rsquo;s) final speech.</a></p>
