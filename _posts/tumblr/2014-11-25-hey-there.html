<p>Wow. This feeling..</p>
<p>I feel good coming back to my blog. Why? because i can say anything i want! Some months on Facebook and you actually are made exceedingly aware of how free or how &ldquo;unfree&rdquo; you are to publicly express your opinion or to present a certain opinion in front of a certain audience. And how much it frustrates on not being able to say what you feel or worry about people&rsquo;s reaction. This anxiety, finally gone! I don&rsquo;t have to pretend to be anyone here.</p>
<p>This hopefully will reinvigorate my enthusiasm about writing more and not getting lost on my way to the keyboard.Â </p>
<p>Edit: This is my 101st post! A milestone reached! :D</p>
