<p>After completing cs101 mid-June, enrolled for st101 class. ST101 is fun; a good refresher for high school Mathematics. Next, continuing my cs course, enrolled in cs253. Python classes were included, but not introduced. That was disappointing. Completed two units anyway. The jargons, and the nitty-gritty details of web app framework are not all explained. You get things done, but how or why are questions you would have to pursue yourself; unlike cs101.</p>
<p>Wandering in the forums, I found posts suggesting cs262 after cs101. Hmm.. enrolled in cs262. Starting cs262, i found myself at ease. Back was the unassuming professor, although this one has an awesome deep voice. After completing a unit, had learned about regexp and fsm. That was actually a lot of fun. I had been wanting to learn regexp since i found about it, and this was a really good introduction. Conclusion: cs262 seems a much gradual step from cs101 than cs253.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, started reading David Evans&rsquo;s book <a href="http://computingbook.org/" title="Computingbook | David Evans " target="_blank">Introduction to Computing</a>(its free!), and books recommended by him in it: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341898627&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=G%C3%B6del%2C+Escher%2C+Bach" title="amazon | books" target="_blank">Gödel, Escher, Bach An Eternal Golden Braid</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Edition/dp/0070004846/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341898668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sicp" title="amazon | books" target="_blank">SICP</a>. Excited!</p>
