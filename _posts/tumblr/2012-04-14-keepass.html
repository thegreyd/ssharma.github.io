<p>My journey with <a href="http://keepass.info" title="keepass" target="_blank">keepass</a> started 2 years ago. I read about it in <a href="http://thinkdigit.com" title="digit" target="_blank">digit</a> : my then healthy-monthly-dose-of-tech magazine. I just loved it . Encryption and key file and Auto-fill.. just captured the nerd in me. Needless to say : Password managers are a great way to manage your online life. Really!</p>
<p>Now I am cannot imagine my life without keepass. It is like a gateway to my online world. I have to set it up everywhere in order to do any serious work. It is available on linux and android and many other platforms, so that is never too hard for me. </p>
<p>Now since the browser is my only major destination of internet activity, it would be logical to have a browser (or a cloud) functionality for managing login credentials. And that would help, being cross-platform. Hence there have also been some good alternatives to keepass; for me mainly-:</p>
<p><strong>Lastpass/1Password</strong> : The online password manager, available as browser extensions and as services(apps) on almost all major platforms(including mobile). </p>
<p><strong>Chrome/Firefox</strong> : They have an in built feature to save login credentials. Chrome syncs the passwords to your google account. While Firefox offers a master password approach and syncs to your firefox account. </p>
<p>The major advantage they offer is auto-fill. You visit a site and -<em>BAM!</em>- your username and password fields are already filled. That is great. While i do save some of my login data in my browser, with the likes of forums and online tutorials and stuff, but nothing major.The problem is knowing that they save my confidential data in <em>the cloud</em>. Ya they have it hardcore multiple encryption-ed and SSL layer to access it, but still. Call me paranoid.</p>
<p>The other gripe i have with Chrome is that several times I need to share my bookmarks and extensions and other stuff, which is synced to my google account. So i sign in. But the access to my username/password also comes with it, and every time someone visits a website ,chrome automatically logs me in to it. I don&rsquo;t want <em>that</em>.  </p>
<p>But fortunately, Keepass has an excellent solution in its hands, just like this, for the browser. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ompiailgknfdndiefoaoiligalphfdae" title="ChromeIpass" target="_blank">ChromeIpass</a>. Ya, it is a browser extension(was originally developed for firefox, as Passifox, by the same author). So,what it does is, it allows the browser to communicate with your offline Keepass database, via a plugin called Keepasshttp, and automatically fills the login credentials of the respective site(which has to be mentioned correctly in the database). Meanwhile, the database has to remain open in the background for the extension to work. Also the firefox version can update old passwords and save new ones. <em>This</em> and creating new entries directly from the browser, is currently in the pipeline for Chrome. <em>Great!</em> </p>
<p>So with these 2 things in place, I am a happy guy. But since this is an offline solution, it becomes very important to make sure to have multiple backups of it ,offline and online, and to regularly update them. I think that is the <em>only</em> major disadvantage with Keepass.    </p>
<p>But I also plan on trying <a href="http://lastpass.com" title="Lastpass" target="_blank">LastPass</a> . And i will be happy to shed my fears and adapt to it, in the near future.   </p>
