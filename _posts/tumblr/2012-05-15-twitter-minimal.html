<a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/65037/twitter-minimal-v3">Twitter Minimal</a><br/><p>Twitter looks crappy. As a micro social network, it is really effective. As a news gathering site, its very efficient. All there is to see(read) is text based tweets. But the layout, in my opinion, does not lay proper emphasis on readability, often times stuffing redundant elements here and there to make the experience frustratingly cluttered.</p>
<p>Taking clues from blogs and news gathering sites (esp. <a href="http://hackerne.ws" title="news ycombinator" target="_blank">hackernews</a>), i have realised that whitespace(or <em>blankspace</em>) plays a vital part in making any interface reader-friendly. There should be a nice balance between content and whitespace. Twitter has an excess of whitespace, which accounts for wasted screen estate and with it, the functionality. </p>
<p>And flashy boxes, buttons, gradients, shadows all just really distract the hell out of it. Did I mention the poorly designed icons; they look so cheap and visually appalling! Why?!</p>
<p>I tried to address some of these issues with the help of my newly acquired CSS skills. Here is my initial effort. Needless to say it&rsquo;s not perfect or perfect being what it claims to be, but that&rsquo;s it. And i am still experimenting with things.</p>
<p>CSS has its limitations. Cosmetic changes are easy to implement. But without JavaScript, you are basically crippled in your task. So in future i do plan to take this forward and make a user-script to make my ideal twitter. </p>
<p>PS: I also plan to do something urgently, about the icons. They are just so bad..</p>
