<p>I write today, with my mind full of conflicted feelings: sadness, guilt. <!-- more -->Failing at a task, where you are responsible for others and expected to do perform well (for good enough reasons) is painful. Questioning your self-worth in times like these, is the most obvious way to deal with the disappointment that washes you. I feel like I often set myself up for failure. Like I can see in plain sight that keeping up with this behavior is not going to get to where I ought to go. Will power, self-regulation and restraint, these are the words that come to my mind(from a video of a professor speaking about procrastination), when I try to figure what I did wrong. Sugar has been my go to drug for times like these. There goes my self-restraint.</p><p>Typing has now become a form of meditation, where every keystroke requires constant watch for the unconscious movements your fingers do when they detect a word pattern. It is hard to keep the muscle memory at the bay.</p><p>A blurb that I read about optimism(and noted it for times like these): &ldquo;To be more optimistic assess good stuff as personal, general and permanent and negative as impersonal, specific and temporal. Make notes everyday about your assessments and correct them.&rdquo; </p><p>I hope what I&rsquo;m doing is some form of the this. I don&rsquo;t want to live in self-delusion, but I also don&rsquo;t want to beat myself up for things I can&rsquo;t control. I suppose it&rsquo;s easy to imagine everything going well, if you would have decided differently.<br/></p>
