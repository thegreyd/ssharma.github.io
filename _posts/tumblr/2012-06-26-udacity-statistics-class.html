<p>Enrolled in the statistics class(<a href="http://www.udacity.com/course/st101" title="udacity - statistics" target="_blank">ST101</a>) by <a href="http://robot.cc" title="Sebastian Thrun - profile" target="_blank">Sebastian Thrun</a> and enjoying it. My first impression of Thrun as a teacher: French-like accent; sometimes sounds a bit too jolly and excited.</p>
<p>When i took <a href="http://www.udacity.com/course/cs101" title="udacity - intro to computer science" target="_blank">CS101</a>, I was thoroughly impressed by <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/" title="David Evans - profile" target="_blank">David Evans</a>, and the way he taught. There was just the right combination of humor and seriousness in his voice. He came out to be a big geek and i could easily relate to him ;and I ended up liking him a lot. Â </p>
