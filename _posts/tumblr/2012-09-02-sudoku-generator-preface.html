<p>This is a personal project of mine which i completed a while ago : A Sudoku generator in Javascript.</p>
<p>It was a time, when i heard my friends were making school projects like calculator, stopwatch, (petty)games and such in Java(IDE). I became quite jealous. Since i wasn&rsquo;t so keen on Java and was instead knee deep into JavaScript; so, JS, it would be.</p>

<p>At the time, I had completed all the projects on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" title="Codecademy | Learn to code" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. But i didn&rsquo;t actually know, what i was going to do (all by myself).    </p>
