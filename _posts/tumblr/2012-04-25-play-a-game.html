<a href="http://thegreyd.tumblr.com/rcs">Play a Game!</a><br/><p>I have been taking <a href="http://codecademy.com" title="codecademy" target="_self">Codecademy</a> lessons (almost religiously) for the past few months. And i have learnt many things. So i wanted to get started with my high web-dev plans and here is my first game. Enjoy! (Mind you, this is pre-Beta.) </p>
