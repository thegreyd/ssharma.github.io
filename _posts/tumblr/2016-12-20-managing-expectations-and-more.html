<p>While writing the previous series of blog posts, I started noting down ideas and feelings I wanted to explore in future blog posts.</p><!-- more --><p>First some things about my writing procedure. I originally intended my routine posts to be short pieces, outpouring something that was on my mind, or I was anxious about. They were meant to be cathartic, which after doing, I would feel better, more calm with myself and my thoughts.</p><p>Thinking, I would write whatever that came to my mind, I found myself going back, revisiting my sentences and restructuring them. This I discovered was a deeply integral part of the experience I was hoping for. While revisiting I was probing, and resolving my internal conflicts. In a humorous way, the end result is the same, but the journey of writing this post is what makes it cathartic. So, I spend a fair amount of time writing, and the process is not impromptu (which I intended for in the first post).</p><hr><p>Expectations shape our experiences. I understood this before in some form or the other, but not until recently have I really internalized this into my life. Before going in something, I have a certain set of expectations, based on which I judge the outcome, how I feel about it. When I go see a movie that I have read about(negatively/positively), which can be said to be fairly hyped: I am often disappointed. As for the opposite, watching something that I don&rsquo;t really have a clue about, I remain fairly neutral/objective about it (not necessarily happy). </p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take much observational strength to notice this pattern all around us. I wrote previously about how our errors in judgement lead us to overestimate or underestimate things, and this is kind of the same thing. Unreasonable expectations deeply affects our relationships, and our happiness. </p><p>I can identify one big agency that gives birth to unreasonable expectations: the popular culture, which encompasses in some sense, the stereotypes in our society and media(including the internet). </p><p>When I came to the United States of America, my mind was brimming with anticipation of things I&rsquo;ve seen and heard (and fantasized about) in its portrayal. I was trying hard, without realizing and not very successfully, to fit what I saw and experienced into this framework, that had been created for me. It stopped me from having authentic experiences, from being mindful and creative; from living reality without a lofty set of standards to compare with. </p><p>I could trace this feeling to my earlier experiences with romantic love. Often feeling confused and conflicted, thinking I was failing at an integral part of life, that you had to get right. &ldquo;There had to be something wrong with me, because this is not how it&rsquo;s supposed to happen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where did I go wrong?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do I deserve this?&rdquo;. These are the kind of thoughts (guilt and shame) that hit you when a distorted worldview fails to make sense of the reality.</p><p>Expectations need to be managed and calibrated. When starting Graduate School, I was introduced to a class policy where the professor and students explicitly discussed their expectations of each other. I found this refreshing. More communication is certainly a big way to calibrate expectations in a relationship. </p><p>If it&rsquo;s a material experience, then I would want to analyze it through multiple point of views to minimize any bias. (I realize that this applies abstractly, to ideas too).</p><p>There is one more thread of thought, a kind of &ldquo;Ignorance is bliss&rdquo;. That knowing less about something will put you in a position where you will not end up disappointed (for example, you would&rsquo;ve invested less time, and therefore feel less personal attachment). For disregarding most of what the pop culture says about things, I would assess it as a net benefit.</p><p>I want to try a more zen way of doing things. Specifically, being aware of the prejudices that you&rsquo;ve been exposed to, and then trying to suppress them. Proceeding to experience reality as an optimistic stranger, while still quietly being aware of what could go wrong. Sounds like a superpower, I&rsquo;d like to have. This maybe what constitutes Mindfulness.</p><p>Again, I would be careful not to say to have no expectations, (similar to Nihilism?), which would be a sad way of living. I do believe that your attitude, and the actions originating from it, affect the material world very much.</p><p>My thoughts aren&rsquo;t fully fleshed out yet. I&rsquo;m throwing big words like &ldquo;the zen way&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mindfulness&rdquo;, “Optimistic Stranger” and &ldquo;Nihilism&rdquo; to describe how I feel, but they maybe inaccurate/confusing. Will write more about this.</p><p>P.S. : I am currently reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. It is the perfect amount of story-telling and thoughtfulness to keep me engaged. </p>
