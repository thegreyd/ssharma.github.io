<p>I want to talk about Man of Steel. And how it ended up affecting my life more than i expected it to.<br/><br/>I remember watching the first trailer of the movie, in awe. It was everything i could ever want from a Superman movie. Epic action coupled with epic music, with Zack Snyder of 300 and Chris Nolan of Batman on the reigns. I was thrilled, beyond doubt.<br/><br/>Let me clarify, a bit. I wasn&rsquo;t a hardcore Superhero or comicbook nerd at the time. Sure, as a kid, i watched Justice League, and Batman: the animated series, and Spiderman cartoon, and loved them. But i never got to a point to really indulge in comicbook mythos and dc/marvel fandom. Sure at some point i wanted to, but couldn&rsquo;t find the time for it. For the recent years, movies were my only gateway for Superheroes. Then came Man of Steel. I became really excited for the movie. I guess being on the internet and surfing /r/movies does you that. The momentum had been building and here was the final push. <br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s some back story. I was looking forward to getting into Western graphic novels. I fired up Google, and searched for some must reads. Soon, a list started getting formed in my mind. Watchmen, V for Vendetta, (Alan Moore stuff..), Y the last man, Maus, Frank Miller stuff.. etc. From reddit and some recommendations, i decided to start with Brian K Vaughn&rsquo;s Y: the last man. The series was awesome, hilarious, and heartbreaking. Enjoyed it very much. I was off to a good start. I explored more author&rsquo;s stuff and came upon his recent series &ldquo;Saga&rdquo;. I read the issues and having an affinity for sci-fi, i was instantly hooked. So for the most part, i successfully got into reading graphic novels and comic books. <br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s some more back story. Two things propelled me towards it. Many of the awesome movies(and tv shows), were and are being based on comics/graphic novels. V for Vendetta, Watchmen, 300, Sin City, Batman trilogy, KickAss, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Arrow, The Walking Dead. I thought it would be better if i read the source material first, in its unaltered, intended form. <br/>Also I read Mangas. Have been reading for 2 and half years, and am a big fan of the Japanese comic culture. I have my fair share of favourites and been wanting to expand my horizons since to other comicbooks, namely American.<br/><br/>Here is some introduction. Mangas in Japan can be seen equivalent to novels in the Western world. They are the staple of storytelling, have been for a long time. It&rsquo;s a major industry there. And it is intended to be read by the general public, children and adults alike. Many notable works of Manga: Astroboy, Dragonball, Pokemon, Beyblade, Akira, Death Note, Crayon-shinchan, Bleach, Naruto, One-piece; and many more which now are very popular in West and in other forms of media (Anime, franchises, video games) etc. They inspired a great number of works. The Mech genre, seen in Transformers(japanese toy line bought by Hasbro) and Pacific Rim, basically comes from manga.<br/><br/>Getting back to the topic, when the Man of Steel trailer #3 came i had been reading Western graphic novels and comics(not superhero stuff). I thought, I couldn&rsquo;t just watch the movie with my half-ass Superman info; I would miss a ton of references and crucial plot points. At this point, I am ready to ready to delve into Superman mythos. I wanted my knowledge of Superman to be definitve. With that in mind, i began reading some of the greatest Superman literature. Here is the full list of Superman comics i read before watching man of steel.<br/><br/></p>
<ul><li>Superman by John Byrne</li>
</ul><ul><li>Superman :Birthright by Mark Waid</li>
</ul><ul><li>All Star Superman by Grant Morrisson</li>
</ul><ul><li>Superman Secret-origins</li>
</ul><ul><li>Superman Secret Identity</li>
</ul><ul><li>Kingdom Come by Mark Waid</li>
</ul><ul><li>Superman Red Son by Mark Miller</li>
</ul><ul><li>Superman for all seasons</li>
</ul><p><br/>Then i understood Superman. I got to know this guy who had so many cool superpowers, he could have accidently melted the entire world with as much of a forethought. All of humanity, and earth look so fragile infront of him that it is ridiculous to think that mere humans or their petty weapons could scratch him. Even the genius Lex Luthor, has to have some kind of Kryptonite, to be able to look Superman in the eye. Buildings, on Earth, to him are basically lego blocks, with humans made of tissue paper. He could walk on the Sun, and never even break a sweat or get sun burnt for that matter. He could push entire planets out of their orbits. The extent of Superman&rsquo;s power is basically unlimited. <br/>    It is not hard to imagine that if Superman ever lost his cool, or may i dare say turned evil, he could wipe out entire mankind in mere seconds. Even his little mistakes could snowball into something catastrophic. But that doesn&rsquo;t happen. He doesn&rsquo;t allow that to happen. And the reason is exactly why Superman is the greatest hero of all time. Not because he is the most powerful superhero. No. It is because he always does the right thing. He is the ultimate model of righteousness. The culmination of every positive trait in humanity. <br/>    He is like the Titan god, Atlas, with the sky resting on his shoulders.<br/>    He has the strongest ideals and the highest standards to live upto. He has a rock solid moral code. There&rsquo;s a reason for that. He has a loving relationship with his parents. His childhood is what turns Clark Kent into Superman. Though he is an Immortal God, walking amongst men, he is the most human of us all. Because he understands humans, he knows their weaknessess, he know where they falter. He oftentimes tries to save humans from themselves. <br/>    The distinction between Superman and other superheroes is an important one. He is not a superhero for selfish reasons, wearing a costume to take vengeance or driven by some inner guilt. He doesn&rsquo;t thrive on people&rsquo;s fear of him as Batman. He doesn&rsquo;t mock his enemies or bullies them like Spider-man. He doesn&rsquo;t do anything flashy for fun, only does what needs to be done. His being a superhero is not a kind of perversion or a inner longing to be a God. He doesn&rsquo;t have a Messiah complex. That is what makes him Superman. He is driven by love, kindness and his ideals for mankind. We believe in Superman because no matter what happens, he will always do the right thing. <br/><br/>That is why i fell in love with Superman.<br/><br/>And then i saw Man of Steel.<br/>And I hated it.<br/><br/>I wouldn&rsquo;t go on length about so many of its disappointing aspects. Here are some links that almost perfectly explain why I hated it -:<br/><br/></p>

</ol><p><br/>Man of Steel reviews have been largely positive. Fans love it. To explain the divide between critics and fans, Man of Steel got 55/100 on Metacritic. On IMDB, it got voted a 7.8/10. People are surprised, why critics are negative about it. On subreddits /r/movies, /r/comicbooks and /r/DCcomics, people(also me) get downvoted for expressing their disapproval of the movie. It has currently earned $500 million and had been breaking box-office records. People really like disaster porn, i guess.<br/><br/>I had huge expectations for this movie. Maybe too much. I was convinced that this movie was going to be so awesome and if something was amiss, it would be me. But that wasn&rsquo;t the case. After leaving the theatre, I was lukewarm about it, saying the CGI action and the Krypton storyline were good. But soon a day after, i couldn&rsquo;t ignore the fact that this rendition of Superman was anything but the one i read in the comics. This movie feels more like set in a Parallel universe. The people who really &ldquo;get&rdquo; Superman would know where it falls short. Ofcourse, it would be out of the way for general public, regular movie-goers and non comicbook nerds, to shake the feeling of movie being great. And expecting that, would be unreasonable. Superman is complicated and the reason for people to say, he is boring. <br/><br/>For me, this did something amazing. It provided the perfect opportunity to get me into superhero comics, and i started enjoying them very much. The irony was that, not liking the movie, was in direct co-relation to me being inspired by the movie to read Superman comics; which if i hadn&rsquo;t done, i think, i would have been a part of the majority group, and would have left the theatre happily, without any deeper afterthoughts/strong opinions. <br/><br/>The lessons I learnt were valuable ones. <br/>Don&rsquo;t take trailers seriously. <br/>And comicbooks are awesome.<br/><br/>Peace.           <br/><br/>          <br/><br/>    </p>
