<p>So, i hear you are a sci-fi movie fan. If so then this is a must watch movie for you. It has Time Travel.., and a troubled Teenager.., and cool Halloween costumes.., and school! What <em>moar</em> awesomeness do you need!?  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/" title="IMDB" target="_blank">Donnie Darko</a>, is undeniably a hard movie from the start. It is an intricate puzzle, by the director, to be understood and solved by the viewer. But it is not only sci-fi, its much more, having a plethora of emotions and hard hitting reality. The music is great and fitting; the acting is spot-on (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0350453/" title="IMDB" target="_blank">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> being amazing!).</p>
<p>I loved it, watching it the first time. And i missed quite a lot of things. I re-watched it ;and then truly loved it.</p>
<p>But, having said that, the reason anyone will hate it is for, it being, too hard to understand, too vague/subtle or being too bold.</p>
<p>At the end, it is a really rewarding and emotionally satisfying viewing experience. Go watch it!</p>
<p><strong><em>PS </em>:</strong> Here are some links to read <strong>after watching it</strong>.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/trivia" title="trivia | IMDB" target="_blank">Donnie Darko trivia</a> and (contains serious Spoilers) <a href="http://metaphilm.com/index.php/detail/donnie-darko/" title="metaphilm | Donnie Darko" target="_blank">Donnie Darko : Explaining the Madness</a>.</p>
