<p>Batman : The Court of Owls was one of my first reads of mainstream Batman comics run. And it was amazing. Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo together make a great pair. I especially like the art, where Batman goes insane. It is done beautifully and while reading i could sense his state of confusion, disorientation. I think i will be buying it in Paperback. Scott Snyder&rsquo;s Batman: Zero year and Superman: unchained are very promising and I look forward to them.</p>
<p>Art is one of the foremost things that i take into factor, while reading comics. I think that is pretty obvious. But when comics with unusual art have great stories, then it is pretty hard for me to keep going. Like Mind MGMT. It is a hard comic to read, and it gets consistently high ratings in reviews.Â </p>
<p>p.s. : Greg Capullo looks so badass; I had a hard time believing the person i was seeing, was a professional artist, rather than a member of a biker club. Respect.</p>
