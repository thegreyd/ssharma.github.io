<p>I have been using <a href="http://codecademy.com" title="Learn to Code" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> for quite a while and here&rsquo;s my opinion about it.</p>
<p>Codecademy&rsquo;s motto is &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo;. Whatever that means, it does sound very vague. There are instructions/descriptions on the left and a code editor on the right. It teaches JS, and HTML and CSS, and Python(very beta); assumes no prior knowledge of programming, and hence is very basic and specific. I think, Codecademy&rsquo;s target audience basically consists of first-timers(students and people), with no relation to programming or code. So, people like me, who are very interested in programming and have prior experience in it, are not exactly welcome. </p>
<p>I come, because i want to learn JS. They teach JS first, because its the easiest to start with, for beginners. See the difference?</p>
<p>I completed the JS lessons on Codecademy nonetheless! And doing it i came across several annoyances, major and minor.</p>
<p><strong>Too specific. Interface problems.</strong> The lessons are very specific and ask for specific code. Very Very Very specific. Like, if you don&rsquo;t do what they envisioned you to do, you can&rsquo;t pass the lesson in hell. This includes many trivial things and is basically tiring. &lsquo;Thinking Out of the box&rsquo;, gone Out of the Box.</p>
<p><strong>Text Only. </strong>All lessons, everything, text only. Can be really boring at times.</p>
<p><strong>No one teacher for a topic or language. Bad Structuring. </strong>You have a variety of teachers for a single language, with each having different methods and patterns. Some can be specific, giving answers in hints, and some can be so vague as to hiding extremely vital information in hints, without pointing towards it! That, irritated me a lot. And structuring of topics, lessons is not great. Useful information about Objects and Arrays is littered in some 'Functions&rsquo; lessons. Basically, a side effect of having different teachers.</p>
<p><strong>(Minor)Badges. </strong>After the initial starting lessons, the attractive badges had worn the color out of them. Seriously?! I have like 55 badges, and half of them being bearing the vague 'yellow-code-robot&rsquo; style. The major gamification aspect of Codecademy, my very first reason for even thinking about joining it, ..gets flushed down the drain. I want them back!!</p>
<p>Despite all its flaws at the moment, i think, codecademy can be much much better if it focuses solely on teaching serious candidates about programming languages, rather than targeting 'the masses&rsquo;. There should be some thresholds, and the lessons accordingly.</p>
<p><em>P.S.- Next is my view on Udacity.</em></p>
<p><em>P.P.S.-'Learn to Code&rsquo;, is actually very silly. More on that later.</em> </p>
