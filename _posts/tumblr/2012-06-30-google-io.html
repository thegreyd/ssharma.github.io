<p>Once in a year Google holds its IO event, and unveils its grand future plans for its products. This year was a special one, with Google launching two brand new hardware products, <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/#/7" title="google nexus 7" target="_blank">Nexus 7</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/#/q" title="google nexus q" target="_blank">Nexus Q</a> , and giving a stunning preview of its futuristic and nerdiest project yet &ndash;&gt; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=google%20glass&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CFoQFjAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplus.google.com%2F111626127367496192147&amp;ei=6jXvT5GkPISGrAe76ei9DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZD1yVou5dCRhH-wGcVf1pPSKPkg&amp;cad=rja" title="Project Glass - google+" target="_blank">Google Glass</a>.</p>
<p>Who knew Google could do hardware? Well, the tablet wasn&rsquo;t a surprise, but impressive for sure. I was really waiting for it, and am keen on buying it. Nexus Q looks cool; not much otherwise.</p>
<p>Onto software - Google+, looks more enticing, now with beautiful mobile apps and new Events feature. Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/versions/jelly-bean.html" title="Android developers | Jellybean" target="_blank">Jellybean</a> introduced, with Project Butter and <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/" title="Google Now" target="_blank">Google Now</a>. Project Butter was so sorely needed. Google Now is a platform to harness Google&rsquo;s search prowess, equipped with its knowledge graph, along with voice recognition; taking forward the Siri-like functionality(without the jibber-jabber). So the major arguments in the android vs ios debate have been addressed; android has matured. </p>
<p>One of the interesting things to me was the absence of standard tablet ui on Nexus 7 and the phone ui instead(with tablet apps). The decision was smart. It is perfectly usable on a 7 inch screen. But what about 10 inch ones? Well, Google advocates the 7 inch being the perfect tablet size, and i fully agree, so never mind. </p>
<p><em>UPDATE</em>: Here&rsquo;s Diana Hackborn&rsquo;s(Android engineer) take on it : <a href="https://plus.google.com/105051985738280261832/posts/6eWwQvFGLV8%C2%A0" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/105051985738280261832/posts/6eWwQvFGLV8 </a></p>
<p>Google Glass&rsquo;s first live demo was a bunch of sky-divers in a G+ hangout jumping on the roof of the conference building. Then came the bikers. It was amazing ,and thrilling!  The prototype version was on pre-order for the attendees, and by 2014 Glass is expected to go for public consumption.</p>
<p>So its fairly evident, that photos and videos are gonna be among the main focuses of Glass. Other than that, we haven&rsquo;t seen anything interesting. It is said to handle text, emails and much more. As for input, there is a touchpad on the right and eye and head motion controls, like blinking and head-tilting. I assume glass is primarily controlled by the eye, but how, i don&rsquo;t know. And what&rsquo;s the ui like? Sergey said it is hard to demonstrate someone operating Glass (for obvious reasons), so i think i would have to suffice with the experiences of tech bloggers having a chance at it. </p>
<p><em>UPDATE</em>: Wired did a nice interview with Glass engineers, clearing some of the above mentioned doubts and more. <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/06/clear-glass-leaders-googles-wearable-computing-breakthrough-explain-it-all-for-you" target="_blank">http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/06/clear-glass-leaders-googles-wearable-computing-breakthrough-explain-it-all-for-you</a></p>
