<p>I love the idea of parallel universes and alternate histories. When we let our mind wander thinking &ldquo;What if..?&rdquo;. One that immediately comes to my mind is Watchmen. Although a superhero comic, it introduces so many radical ideas that gradually, blow your innocent, naive little mind. The ones i have read, mostly deal with some altered version of world war 2 where Hitler doesn&rsquo;t rise to power, or Germany wins the war.</p>
<p>The Manhattan Projects is a wonderful comic book series which deals with this very concept. It has a cast of immeasurable proportion of scientific credibility and creativity : Einstein, Oppenheimer, Feynman, Fermi, and many others.     </p>
<p>p.s. : Hitler was a vegan. </p>
