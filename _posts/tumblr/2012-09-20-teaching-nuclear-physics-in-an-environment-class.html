<p>This happened to me 2 days ago.</p>
<p>Went to College. Sat at the last bench with a fellow boy. Environment-cum-Ecology period starts. This female teacher(25-30) starts babbling about Nuclear Energy. </p>
<p>Asks questons about &ldquo;what it is&rdquo;. </p>
<p>I raise my hand and speak something about nuclear fission, total mass of product less than the reactant, e=mc2. </p>
<p>Apparantly, not satisfied enough. She says &ldquo;Radioactivity&rdquo; and asks questions like &ldquo;why unstable nuclei?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;p/n ratio?&rdquo;. She is (and had been) a Chemistry teacher. Noone answers. </p>
<p>Tells students to come prepared next time. Says something about Radioactive decay. Next, starts to dictate. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Who discovered Radioactivity?&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Marrie Curie and Peirre Curie&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Nope.&ldquo;Enrico Fermi in 1936&rdquo;.</p>
<p>REALLY? (Ofcourse not!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fusion Energy is not currently possible, so we will only discuss Nuclear fission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well..</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a heavier radioactive nucleus breaks down into 2 smaller nucleus, the energy obtained is known as Nuclear Energy. [&hellip;] Nuclear Energy is of 2 types - Fission and Fusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(LOOLLL!!)snickers..</p>
<p>Again starts asking Questions.</p>
<p>I say to my partner, about the teacher being stupid and, her asking questions and not actually knowing the answers. Partner Smiles.</p>
<p>Notices it and the two of us, and goes on to scold us about being unattentive. Creates a big fuss.</p>
<p>No questions asked about the Nuclear Energy.</p>
<p>Says(threatens us) to prepare and to explain the relevant topics introduced, &ldquo;full!&rdquo;, in the next class(the next day).</p>
<p>Ok. Smug smile&hellip;.</p>

<p>AFTERMATH:</p>
<p>Issues &ldquo;Atomic and Nuclear Physics&rdquo;, from the College Library.</p>
<p>Fires up wikipedia and starts reading. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Nucleus&rdquo;, &ldquo;RadioNuclei&rdquo;, &ldquo;Radioactive decay&rdquo;, &ldquo;Binding Energy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mesons&rdquo;, &ldquo;Alpha decay&rdquo;, &ldquo;Gamma rays&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beta decay&rdquo;, &ldquo;Protons&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nuetrons&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nuclear fission&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nucleons&rdquo;. &ldquo;Nuetron Activation&rdquo;, &ldquo;Magic Numbers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Positron&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nuclear Energy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Half life period&rdquo;, &hellip;.</p>

<p>The next day. Last bench.</p>
<p>Teacher enters class. Smiles and calls my name, inviting me to explain.</p>
<p>Heh.. Goes to the stage and starts explaining on the board. &ldquo;Marie Curie and Peirre Curie discovered Radioactivity in 1898.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why radioactivity? For that we need to delve into the nucleus and its stability&rdquo;. Moar physics!</p>
<p>Some unsuccessful attempts of teacher to question. It is clearly not her domain.</p>
<p>I am in a hurry, don&rsquo;t pay her any attention and continue to address the class.</p>
<p>She makes an attempt to call my partner, to come and explain. &ldquo;Mam!&rdquo;, but i smoothly say &ldquo;ten minutes more, please.&rdquo; All laugh. Her face turns red. </p>
<p>I am on a roll. She didn&rsquo;t expect this at all.</p>
<p>After, half hour of me being awesome, i rest my case.</p>
<p>She is pissed off. Like really! Scolds me for being &ldquo;Disrespectful in addressing her&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Addresses class : &ldquo;It was just a practice for being more confident, for future presentations.&rdquo; &ldquo;I gave you freedom, but you students abused it.&rdquo; &ldquo;From now on, i won&rsquo;t provide any extra help, guidance, and everything will be strictly business.&rdquo; Gives some Assignments. Leaves. </p>
<p>Classmates flock towards me, shake my hand, congratulate me.</p>
<p>I won.     </p>
