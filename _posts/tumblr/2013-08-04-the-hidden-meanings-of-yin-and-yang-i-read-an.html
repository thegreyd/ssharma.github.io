<p>I read an interesting quote the other day along the lines of:-</p>
<p><em>Morality exists only in the realm of the conscience or conscious.</em></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that, Morality cannot be taken as absolute. When we strive to be good in our lives, and despise the people who are evil/bad, there exists no absolute good or bad in the universe.</p>
<p>It makes all the more confounding to think, that there is no actual scale to measure morality against, on which our human society exists, and the foundations of Justice are laid upon.  </p>
<p>No humans, means no morality. I think, we can very well argue that there is no justice to speak off, in nature, or in evolution. It all seems to be in our petty minds.</p>
<p><strong>Things happen, that&rsquo;s why they do happen. There&rsquo;s nothing good or bad about them.</strong> I think that&rsquo;s what the universe is saying to us.</p>
<p>It might be safe to believe that, Yin and Yang exist in everything. Or this might be my defense mechanism making me believe that there exists a remote definition of good and bad in things, although, mixed.</p>
<p>So, nothing is black or white. <strong>Everything is grey. </strong>Right? Grey the cosmic color. Or is it Black? Space is black; universe is mostly black. No it shouldn&rsquo;t be black, it reminds me of the evil doom! NOOooooo!! </p>
