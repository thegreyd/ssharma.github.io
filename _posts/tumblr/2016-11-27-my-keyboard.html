<p>So i bought a new, relatively cheap, mechanical keyboard, which i am currently typing on. It clicks a lot, and has huge keys, which is the part of the reason I bought it.<!-- more --> Been practicing typing for a month now, and as expected, my speed and accuracy have significantly improved. But the mechanical keyboard was just a gadget that I always desired(makes you feel like 1337 haX0r), so typing was just an excuse to get my hands on it. Part of my desire to be better at touch typing was after I attended a university programming competition. Students who were competing were racing away at their keyboards. Even before that I had noticed, in the library, the average typing skill of the people around me, was way better than I imagined it would be. That made me really envy them. My typing wasn&rsquo;t that bad, but I realized that touch typing was an essential skill that I was better improving now than later.<br/></p><p>Which brings me on to a related skill, the skill of conversation. When talking to strangers, this is the number one thing, that can make a difference. I have noticed many common phrases which initially puzzled me as to what the right reply could be. Then I realized they were these psuedo phrases customary to a conversation, acting as mere tokens. But still not using them would be considered rude. You just use these magic words to start or end a conversation. </p><p>Like typing for a computer person, conversation, and writing are skills that every person should try be effective at. Which is where I think mindfulness makes a difference. My personal experience has shown that a slow, deliberate attempt at talking will give you much better outcome(otherwise I often fumble or say incoherent things). Even when I type, a slow start of getting in the rhythm, gives me a better accuracy and consistent speed. When I force myself to be speedier it&rsquo;s usually a trainwreck, which you can&rsquo;t recover from afterwards.</p><p>The website I practice on: <a href="http://www.keybr.com">www.keybr.com</a><br/>Soundtrack I am listening to right now: [Spectra by Chipzel] : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5ZJ6Q6PTpk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5ZJ6Q6PTpk</a></p>
