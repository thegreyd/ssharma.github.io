<p>This is my first day of writing my thoughts down as they come to me. Once I type something, I am not going to erase it, so this is basically speaking out loud. Might be a little incoherent but here it goes.</p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>Social anxiety is one thing that has been on my mind these last few days. I have always been an anxious person; whether I successfully mask it or not is a mix of my mood, practice and, what people may call mindfulness. This maybe somehow related to the concept of introvert and extrovert. I used to think that I am an introvert but, as I have seen myself exhibiting extroverted behavior in many situations when I want to be seen extroverted, my thinking has changed. <br/></p><p>To be clear,Â  I used to think that introverts are somehow handicapped in social situations, but that is not the case. As I recently read about the topic, that introverts do not lack the ability to be very social, it is usually a matter of preference. <br/></p><p>I notice that I have digressed from the topic. What originally required this introspection was my coming in a new country, and feeling a new wave of anxiousness. It has been 4 months and after observing my own behavior, I have concluded that even though I greatly desire meeting new foreign people, I am often crippled by fear. <br/></p><p>What happens next is more unusual, because of my crippling fear, my terseness comes off as a general lack of interest or having nothing interesting to speak of. I am very good at masking my fear, but this trying to escape from the social situation, marks me as an individual not particularly worth approaching.</p><p>As I now listen to slow piano music, my mind tells me how self-destructive this technique of social escapism is. It comes as snobbish, rude and arrogant, while unaware to people around me, I am in the anxiety hell. I started to observe others in similar situation. What I found effective in their behavior, was they communicated their feeling very well, even when a little anxious. This elicited an empathetic response from the person they were conversing with. <br/></p><p>In hindsight this seems so painfully obvious; how wrong I was in my intent to hide my feelings of conflict. Humans are very empathetic creatures, but for empathy to work, you have to show your feelings first. I am trying to be that person, where I am more open to my surroundings. <br/></p><p>This was a therapeutic session for me. I hope to write more, to get hold of my thoughts and navigate this internal landscape. <br/></p><p>Here&rsquo;s the music I was listening to: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8kTInuEK4M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8kTInuEK4M</a></p>
