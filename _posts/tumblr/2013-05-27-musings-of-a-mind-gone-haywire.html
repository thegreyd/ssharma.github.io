<p>I am bored. When i say i am bored, i mean by hyper activity. This is not new. This has been going on for a long time. Longer than i care to acknowledge. Tomorrow is my Mid-sem exam, and as a result i am not studying. Yes, i spell that right. Exam nights always had the opposite effect on me. For the last two days, i hadn&rsquo;t pick up my test books. i am not all that attentive in class either, so i barely remember a thing. As of right now, i fervently browse Reddit, watch Starcraft WCS europe finale, switch to my tablet to superman comics, and think to myself &ldquo;WTH am i doing?&rdquo;. And i am typing.</p>
<p>This might have to do with my attention span, which might be short. Maybe i am gifted, like those famous personalities with personality disorders. I like that explanation. Or maybe i&rsquo;m just making stuff up.</p>
<p>No. This has to do with my grades. So fundamentally i am lazy. Being lazy, i look for the shortest, quickest, way i can get past things. If i get satisfactory grades, by just one night of studying, i do that. I have tried, and i did get results. Thus follows this procrastination. Until the very last moment. Stretching it as much as i can, without completely breaking it. Meanwhile choosing to ignore the dread, and the tension. Maybe i am just too self confident. Maybe i read too much Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>This is crazy. I also wrote a Flash fan fiction today. Watched 3 episodes of Arrow. Read a dozen comic book issues. Went to eat lunch at a family friend&rsquo;s house. And four hours of sleeping. On the night of my main Semester exam, now months past me, i watched Django Unchained, and Silver lining Playbook. This feels like a drug. Or i think so.</p>
<p>Did i mention my recent obsession with comic books and superheroes? In 2 days, i downloaded 100+ comicbooks. In 2 days I have read:</p>
<ul><li><span>1986-Man of Steel, </span></li>
<li><span>Superman Birthright, </span></li>
<li><span>Superman Secret origin</span></li>
<li><span>Superman Secret Identity</span></li>
<li><span>Kingdom come</span></li>
<li><span>Red son </span></li>
<li><span>some flash, some daredevil</span></li>
<li><span>new 52 superman series</span></li>
</ul><p>How did this start you ask? Man of Steel. The frigging Man of steel official trailer #3!! It was awesome. It gave me superhero nerd-chills; ones, I never knew existed. I got so excited watching it and reading comments on reddit about it, i decided this was the perfect time, i did my crash course on superheroes. I unleashed myself on comics. Old-school, new -school dc, marvel, silver age, bronze age. Bring it on!</p>
<p>And then i thought why not write a fan fic on superheroes? A superman fan fic? Hell yeah! I had my literary guns ready to blaze, for quite some time now. My body was ready*.  </p>
<p>My computer clock now shows 00:08. At 10:00 tomorrow, my exam would start. My main semester exam starts from June 14. The same day as Man of Steel releases, in theaters near me. Fast and Furious, is showing now. I rather watch trailer #3 again, than risking disappointment. After some self introspection, this seems like an excuse to me, an illusion, rather grand. The forces continue to fight. Rejecting the reality. The Sith and the Jedi. It feels deliberate. </p>
