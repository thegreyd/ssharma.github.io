<p>After reading great reviews of it, I had been eyeing the horror movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521/" title="imdb" target="_blank">Cabin in the woods</a> since long; and having finally watched it, i can say this: <strong>it&rsquo;s Brilliant!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>                                             <img align="middle" alt="spooky poster." height="317" src="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNTUxNzYyMjg2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTExNzExNw@@._V1._SY317_.jpg" width="214"/></strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>For the record, i am not a huge follower of the horror genre, but i have seen enough films to make out the sometimes-subtle, often-inyourface satire in it.</p>
<p>There were so many occasions where you think you know the story, but the film is full of unexpected delights; horror and comical at the same time! </p>
<p>The story is full of symbolism, waiting to be discovered, but even without it, the film doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. It&rsquo;s a must-must watch for horror fans. As for the others.., its a must watch!</p>
