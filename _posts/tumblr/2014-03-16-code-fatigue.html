<p>The code i write is scattered across sites, computers, drives, folders and there is an increasing probability of me forgetting everything. :(</p>
<p>So now begins the expedition to refactor it nicely in my github.</p>
<p>I will call it <em>&ldquo;The Greyd Code Movement&rdquo;</em>  or <strong>T.G.C.M</strong>.</p>
<p>i love acronyms. </p>
