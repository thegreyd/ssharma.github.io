<p>I feel we often times try to project ourselves as immune to the difficulties and pressures of the world(even though we are not), and often time that&rsquo;s a deeply annoying and unattractive for people around.<!-- more --> As important it is to not rant about how everything is falling apart in your life, the same is true to not put up this supreme know-all confident image, and recognize that you are an imperfect human being. As goes the saying, &ldquo;A little bit of humility goes a long way.&rdquo; One such incident happened with me when my recent friend told me she had this image of my being very disciplined and proper in all my work, which I told her was obviously not the reality. Somehow I wondered, I subconsciously put this image of a perfect person, which makes it hard for people to actually get to know you. This I imagine is a scale of 2 extremes(arrogant-perfect and overly-insecure) where every person has to find the sweet spot.<br/></p><p>One another such incident was when I was talking to a very outgoing friend, who I assumed would have been actively going out on dates, which was again not accurate. He told me he just hadn&rsquo;t tried yet, and felt kind of the same insecurities which I had in my head. We sympathized with each other, exchanging a few encouraging tips, while I thought about what had caused this error in my perception of him. This is bad generalization, but I feel, we exaggerate the differences between ourselves and others a lot. We are bad judges of how we sit in the spectrum, whether it be how intelligent we are, how happy we are compared to others. The grass is greener on the other side of the fence, i.e. until you actually go and visit the other side. </p><p>I&rsquo;m trying to get rid of all the preconceived notions/wild theories about the people around me, where it would just be a better idea to ask them. Iâ€™m realizing how simple this sounds, but how effective it would be if people started doing it.</p>
