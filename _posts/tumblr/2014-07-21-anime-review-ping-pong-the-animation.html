<p>This is the first sports anime that i have watched, so essentially i have bypassed a lot of mediocre shows, and jumped straight on to a good one. </p>
<p>I personally play ping pong so this show is special for me. The character dynamics of this show is superb; the imagery, symbolism is refreshing and exciting.</p>
<p>The background music fits perfectly in matches and in crucial moments. And the opening theme is catchy, something you can listen to again and again, one of my favorites.</p>
<p>The art style and animation are not typical anime, and are again refreshing from the all-too-similar-moe style. I was quite pleased with the matches, animated wonderfully. </p>
<p>This is a story about Heroes and <span>Monsters </span>; about Peco and Smile. A special mention to Kazama and Kong as being 2 great side characters of the show. Pretty much every character had a purpose and a back story.</p>
<p>Ping Pong the animation had a strong emotional impact on me. It is highly enjoyable. </p>
<p><span>A sports fan or not, I would recommend it to everyone. </span></p>
