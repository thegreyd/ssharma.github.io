Religion is a thing of the past. Atheists are highly intelligent and self-reflective. That&rsquo;s our Achilles heel. We are very independent. He&rsquo;s saying we need to be cultural and communal. Believers are sheep, thus communal.</em>&rdquo;- <em>Jaysee5</em></p>

<p>While I do agree on some points made by him, my overall feelings can be condensed in the above comment by Jaysee5. </p>
<p>I do not believe on God and religion. But I am not the atheist described by him. Being an extremist atheist, would kinda defeat the whole purpose. Here, you would still follow a religion, albeit a cleverly disguised one.</p>
<p>Being an atheist does things to you. You do question the slightest of things, which makes your life seemingly cynical. People around you see you as a weirdo. But that is, perfectly fine. They have their God. You have yourself. </p>
<p>It still can&rsquo;t be ignored that religion makes human beings highly effective as a community. Yes, repeating a thing 10 times a day, and forcing people to go look at the moon, makes them efficient, and maybe ultimately happy.</p>
<p>However this forcing of the &ldquo;greater truth&rdquo; on people, again is Totalitarian. <strong>I will read Shakespeare and only I will decide if I like it or not. Art IS subjective. Forcing people to appreciate art, is again, a doctrine.</strong></p>
<p>Another argument, (which is frequently employed by my fatheragainst me), is that &ldquo;<strong>You do not need to reinvent the wheel.&rdquo; </strong></p>
<p>Maybe while watching the video, i had an epiphany. I discovered the greater truth of life. And I go on to become a &ldquo;great man&rsquo;, and lead a peaceful life, while I write down my experiences, in my book. I give it to my followers, so that they could teach the young ones, on how to find the &quot;greater truth&rdquo;, and then go on to live happily. That would be very noble of me. But it would be like saying, &ldquo;Let me make decisions for you. Let me guide you to heaven.&rdquo; Completely baffling. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Even if you are correct, saying it&rsquo;s the only way to do things right is stupid. <strong>Everybody has to invent</strong> <strong>their own wheel. Anything otherwise would not be human. It would be a machine, with a set of instructions.</strong>       </p>
<p>But that is actually the question. Do you want to be happy/content? Or do you want to explore, know the true nature of things? The latter involves restlessness. Wanting either is normal, and I am not here to judge anyone. Being in a community does make life a happier place to live in. It is more fulfilling, more satisfying, more justifying. Being alone, is actually hard.    </p>
<p>The Matrix portrayed this dilemma beautifully. When given the choice between Blue pill and Red pill, most people will choose the Blue pill, and remain inside the Matrix. They WILL lead a worry-free life, which is what they want. But for some, that is not where the excitement lies.</p>
