<p>One of my favorite on-going fantasy series is <a href="http://disney.go.com/official-sites/heroes-of-olympus/index" title="Heroes of Olympus | Disney" target="_blank">Heroes of Olympus</a> by <a href="http://www.rickriordan.com" target="_blank">Rick Riordan</a> (continuing Percy Jackson and the Olympian series). Today, the third book in the series is finally released : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mark-Athena-Heroes-Olympus-Book/dp/1423140605" title="Mark of Athena | Amaon" target="_blank">The Mark of Athena</a>. </p>

<p>I have been a big fan and follower of Percy Jackson books; got hooked to them pretty early and loved them since. Greek Mythology is captivating with epic characters and stories, and the author builds the premise, taking them in our world. The books are full of humor, action, thrill making them real page-turners. </p>
<p>Heroes of Olympus series takes the stories to the next level. New characters, more scary Monsters, Gods, and more exciting epic adventures! And with a twist of Roman Mythology. I have read the two previous books and they have been fantastic. Really eager to read this one.</p>
