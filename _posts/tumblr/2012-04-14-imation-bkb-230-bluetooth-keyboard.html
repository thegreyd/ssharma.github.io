<div class="line fk-font-big bmargin5">I had been looking for a good bluetooth keyboard for quite some time. Was a little unsure about buying it when i saw it online(by the lack of proper mention/review of it on the internet ). I wanted it to work with my desktop, tablet ,and smartphone as well. But, it was a bluetooth keyboard; what possibly could have gone wrong?</div>
<p class="line bmargin10">Having bought it, I can easily say this: The keyboard works, as would any other normal BT keyboard.</p>
<p class="line bmargin10">There are numerous other such keyboards selling at Ebay and Amazon, usually as &ldquo;keyboard for ipad&rdquo; and for other tablets . I think they are all identical. But this is the first of its kind which i have noticed to sell in black, which is why i liked it even more.  </p>
<p class="line bmargin10">And it definitely has the potential to become an ideal companion for my tablet. It can also be seen as a cheap alternative to the apple keyboard ,sans the aluminium body (plastic instead). It has matte keys and island type keyboard, making it easy to type. Range is upto, a sufficient,10 metres.</p>
<p class="line bmargin10"><br/>Here are the pros and cons -:<br/><br/></p>
<ul><li>Supports HID bluetooth profile.</li>
<li>Small, lightweight, slim and portable.</li>
<li>Chiclet type keyboard.</li>
<li>Supports pc(windows7/vista/xp), Mac, iPad.</li>
<li>[tested] Works with my Android smartphone and tablet (and pc).</li>
<li>Hotkeys work. Led indicator.</li>
<li>Sits slightly slanted with a firm grip.</li>
<li>Cheaper than others.</li>
<li>With 1 year limited warranty.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Feels quite delicate.</li>
<li>Layout similar to apple keyboard; may take some time to get accustomed to( position of alt,cntrl keys).</li>
<li>Some keys may wear out a little; start producing a loud -click- sound when pressed.</li>
<li>[minor] battery slot a little loose.</li>
</ul>
