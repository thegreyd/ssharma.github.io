<p>DEATH NOTE Original Soundtrack (Full)</p>
<p>THIS. This is awesomesauce! So much music nirvana, it&rsquo;s just gold!. Especially the first half with the guitars.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDkQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0758742%2F&amp;ei=ey4wUZn2AoP9rAfCuYCwDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzwDn3S0xaqlYUgP1jceE-klGJ0w&amp;bvm=bv.43148975,d.bmk" title="imdb | death note" target="_blank">Death Note </a>is a Japanese anime series, and is great in its own right. The soundtrack really shines all through it, and gives every character, every situation its own unique track, making the experience truly engaging. I never knew a tv series(or cartoon/anime for that matter) can have music this profound; until i finally saw death note. </p>
<p>TL;DR : If you need something, while you do your homework, or to get into the mood or get inspired or motivated or chilled or pumped up, this is it.</p>
