<p>These are pretty great resources for patterns/textures for background for your website/webpage/blog. </p>

</ul><p>Learn how to add these patterns.</p>
<p><span>HOW TO -:</span></p>
<ul><li>download the png/gif from the website of your choice.</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t freak out because the image is so tiny, remember we want a pattern.</li>
<li>insert the following code in your css file (preferably in body{}).</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>background-image:url(<em>path\name.png</em>);</p>
<p>background-repeat:repeat;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(there is also a shorthand for it.. but i&rsquo;m not going to mention it.)</p>
<p>Now most pattern i prefer are easy on the eyes, not to dominative. You may have difficulty in finding textures in colors other than different shades of grey ;they are the most used. If you want to add a shade/vibe of your own choice of color, you can easily do so. (I really liked a color as my background, but i wanted texture as well. The desired texture was nothing but grey(hey, i like grey but sometimes it becomes overwhelming!) So I wanted that texture with my bg color!). </p>
<p>I am sure there are numerous other methods* to do the following, but you can say i have not entirely explored them;i&rsquo;m not gonna mention them. (But if i feel some method being easier or better than this, i might update the post or write a new one)</p>
<p>HOW TO-:</p>
<ul><li>Open the image in an image editor. <em>I did this in Paint.net</em> .</li>
<li>Add a new Layer above it and fill it with your desired color.</li>
<li>In the layer properties of the new Layer, adjust the <em> Opacity,</em> to make it transparent so that the color merges with the texture<em>.</em></li>
<li>Keep tweaking untill you get the right combination.</li>
<li>Save the new image as png/gif. Proceed to flatten the image.</li>
<li>Use the new image in your code.</li>
</ul><p>*There are new options in CSS3 to set the opacity property in the code itself. And the RGBa values let you provide color with a transparent property. So I am trying find other ways to do this in the code itself without using image editor. </p>
