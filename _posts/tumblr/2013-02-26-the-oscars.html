<p>They were mostly good. The host was funny, tall and had a solid voice. life of pi won many awards as expected. And also les miserables. Although i wish, de niro got the award for, best actor in supporting role. And Adele won oscar for best song; now &ldquo;let the skyfaaaawwwwlllll&rdquo;!.</p>
<p>Anne Hathaway looked stunning! And so did Hugh Jackman in the beard. Jennifer Lawrence winning best actress, was great(although she fell..lol)! Argo won best picture. I have to try watching it again now, as i fell asleep the first time. Ben Affleck, while giving his speech, spoke like he was on crack. George Clooney was as always,.. suave.</p>
<p>Bradley Cooper.. why you grow long hair?Â </p>
<p>Michelle Obama at Oscars live from White House (and there too, surrounded by.. idk.. boys in funny dresses?)!!<span>Whut!?</span></p>
<p>And I love Ted. His words are beautiful, as can be, coming from a soft toy who smokes weed.</p>
