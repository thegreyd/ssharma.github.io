<hr><p>If I had to
summarize all my motivations of creating this blog into one line, it
would be <!-- more -->
</p><p>“We think too
much, and write too little.” 
</p><p>OR</p><p>“We eat too much
and shit too much, and digest(absorb would be a better term..?) too
little.”</p><p>This is a conscious
effort to bring the vast majority of our abstract thoughts to a more
concrete form , in opinions, reviews, rants or any piece of writing.
I believe this as an immeasurably useful tool to achieve Clarity of
Thought. It so happens, that we don&rsquo;t realize how utterly stupid and
irrational something in our head is, that we believe, until we
actually write it down, formulate it.<br/></p><p>I feel this is way
more important now, that we consume a shit load of content,
ideologies, propaganda everyday consciously or unconsciously, that we
need to figure stuff out. It is way more overwhelming with the high
speed Internet at our fingertips, you can read, watch whatever you
want, anytime anywhere. So this is a place we figure stuff out.
Remove the Noise, from the Signal.<br/></p><p>This I believe would
greatly help us be more productive, and as we achieve clarity of
thought, figure out connections between previously assumed complex
things. And our thoughts to be more adventurous. I am hopeful.<br/></p><p>P.S. : Maybe this becomes a barren wasteland after 1 or 2 months, we become too lazy. But still it’s worth a try.</p>
