<p>Watched it. Was quite surprised with how good it was. Chris Evans was great.</p>
<p>A metaphor about society, industrialism, capitalism; the train can interpreted in so many different ways. But the ending dialogue between Wilford and Curtis, is what stood out for me, and what left me wondering. Ultimately I view Wilford as a good person.</p>
<p>The film tries to touch on the subject as to things you have to do in order to save humanity or for the greater good. Most people are stupid and without a leader, people would go extinct anyday. Therefore the need arises for the intelligent to manipulate the masses for their own good. Anything that happens in order to achieve that is justifiable.</p>
<p>It is quite a repelling idea but a powerful one.Â </p>
