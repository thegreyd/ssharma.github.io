<p><strong>Existentialism</strong> : The philosophy that emphasizes freedom of choice and personal responsibility but also regards human existence in a hostile universe as unexplainable.</p>
<p><strong>Nihilism</strong> : The rejection of all religious and moral principles, often in the belief that life is meaningless</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be philosophical. A scientist isn&rsquo;t a philosopher. And because I want to be a scientist. But a rationalist does deal with philosophical thoughts with scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>So why do we exist?</strong></p>
<p><em>“We’re here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?”</em>  Was <strong>Steve Jobs</strong> right? What is this dent? </p>
<p>What do we achieve by living? To change the cosmic timeline of our universe in a way so that it benefits or maybe remembers humanity? To survive?</p>
<p>There must be a reason. <strong>Evolution makes the reason a necessity</strong>. Why are the most evolved living beings, sentient beings? Does sentience makes us more likely to survive? Yes, it does. Why sentience? So we are intelligent enough to break out of this dead decaying body? To break this shell and become immortal? Become something greater? Something permanent?</p>
<p><strong>Why evolution?</strong> Evolution, the nurturing mother of life. What does she want from Life to achieve?  </p>
<p> Is survival the only goal? To let her child live, till the last minute? If we are going to die eventually, so why not live till the last second. Enjoy life. The impending doom is unavoidable, by definition.</p>
<p><strong>If we are going to die eventually, so why live at all?</strong></p>
<p>Is evolution a tiny force of good, fighting against a never ending unimaginably big, cold behemoth, who in slumber waits for everything to die out and ends everything with ending himself. An act of self- destruction. Is it the key to creation? One dies to make the way for the other?</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Neither can live while the other survives&rdquo;</em>. Just like <strong>J.K. Rowling</strong> imagined.</p>
<p>But the universe isn&rsquo;t sentient. Or is it? Is the Universe, God? <br/>This doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try making some sense. You ask someone why we live.</p>
<p>We live because we live. We live for others. Others live for us. We live for each other. We live for humanity. This is circular logic. Who does humanity live for? Ofcourse the answer is, &lsquo;Itself&rsquo;. It is a self-contained world like a fish bowl, where the fish lives and dies; for itself.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think.</p>
<p> We live for finding out these answers. We live to understand the universe. <strong>To understand the reason, some boring molecules and atoms combined together, were brought to life, which ended up questioning about the existence of the boring molecules and atoms that make them, and to them being sentient.</strong></p>
<p>This will be a long journey. When at the end of Universe, we can finally understand everything. It will be a meaningful end. To come to peace with ourselves. No unanswered questions and everything figured out. <strong>Then we can die being content; that we did our job; we answered the ultimate question. <br/></strong></p>
