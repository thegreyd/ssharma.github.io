<a href="http://thegreyd.tumblr.com/lab3">n00b Lab v3</a><br/><p>Phew. Completed version 3 of &lsquo;n00b Lab&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Changes include -:</p>
<ul><li>New transition effect for logo and nav elements.</li>
<li>Rounded border of main content section. </li>
<li>Better spacing and management.</li>
<li>Increased font size.</li>
<li>Added 'Designed by..&rsquo; element in footer.</li>
<li>Separate 'theme&rsquo; class added to better classify/manage css for similarly styled elements and to maintain consistency. </li>
<li>Code is much cleaner now by introducing new classes and with minimum redundancy.</li>
</ul><p>Hmm.. Next version to include images and image borders and stuff and maybe some other style changes(?)..</p>
