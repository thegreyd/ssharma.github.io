<p>&ldquo;The Steins;Gate has chosen!!&rdquo;. Spoken by a mad scientist, these words are to make as much sense to the unsuspecting reader, as to me; which is to say, not much. </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=11770" title="ANN | Steins;Gate" target="_blank">Steins;Gate</a> bestows upon us, the thrilling tale of a self-proclaimed mad scientist&rsquo;s journey in time. Through the thick first episodes, we glide into the grand world of Rintaro Okabe, as we watch him, mutter alone to his cellphone, build codes for innocuous interactions, invent gadgets in his &ldquo;lab&rdquo;, spew geektalk-jargon and rhetorical speeches in third person, like poetry. Needless to say, he is our ultimate sci-fi protagonist(reminded me of Sheldon from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/" title="Big Bang Theory | IMDB" target="_blank">BBT</a>, at times)</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike other animes I have watched(<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=10216" title="FMA:B | ANN" target="_blank">FMA:B</a>, <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6704" title="Code Geass R1 | ANN" target="_blank">Code-Geass</a>), Steins;Gate has a small, albeit, a strong, ensemble of incredibly well thought-out memorable characters, each adding a new dimension. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>About the story</strong>: It is a sci-fi with a heavy emotional underbelly. Time travel, time leap, time paradoxes, parallel universes(or world-lines), with evil organisation to boot, makes it incredibly gobble-worthy to the nerd-senses. Emotional themes like friendship, love, life and death are dramatically portrayed, as the hero gets caught up in emotional crises resulting from the repercussions of his supernatural endeavors. </span></p>
<p>Comprising of 24 episodes(+1 extra OVA), the story is aptly paced, doesn&rsquo;t feel stretched out,(Death Note, i&rsquo;m looking at you) with each episode having its<em> -Aha!</em>- or <em>-OhShit!</em>- moments. And the climax actually delivers!! </p>
<p><span>The not-so-good-things mostly comprise of some neglected plot holes in favor of an emotional arc. There are times when it may feel dull and with seemingly sporadic stuff happening. Also the initial two episodes were difficult, which may throw off casual viewers.</span></p>
<p><span>I watched the dubbed version, and the voice acting done, was remarkable. The dialogues were magnificently littered with technical-scientific lingo, internet slang, and cultural references. It was so funny at times! I was totally smitten.</span></p>
<p><span>The background music is fitting. And the awesome closing track/sequence has become one of my favorites.</span></p>
<p><span>Conclusion: Easily one of the best Animes i have watched. Now putting it on my watch-again list.</span></p>
<p><span>P.S: The next installment of the story: <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13542" title="Steins;gate Deja vu | ANN" target="_blank">a movie</a> releasing this year! Woot!!</span></p>
