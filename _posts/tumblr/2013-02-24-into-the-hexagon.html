<p>My introduction to S<a href="http://superhexagon.com" target="_blank">uper Hexagon</a> was when <a href="http://theverge.com" target="_blank">Verge</a> came out and in the &ldquo;play this&rdquo; section was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/26/2826310/play-this-hexagon" target="_blank">featured</a> a flash game called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/TerryCavanagh_B/hexagon" target="_blank">Hexagon</a>&rdquo; (wow, its almost an year!), simple, eye-catching yet feverishly difficult. Made by <a href="http://distractionware.com" target="_blank">Terry Cavanagh</a>, this game caught attention of many people for its minimalism and retro style.</p>

<p><span>The basic premise of the game is to navigate a little triangle in the center by moving it clockwise or anti-clockwise, through obstacles, as they head towards you. did i mention the music? Awesome retro video game music accompanies as you die countless times. And it eventually grows on you.</span></p>
<p><span>Why is it called hexagon? It has 6 levels of 10 seconds(former 3) and 15 seconds(latter 2) and last level(Hexagon) is indefinite(goes on, until you eventually die). And the obstacles, they are <strike>open polygons</strike> well.. not exactly, but you know.., killer geometrical shapes. </span></p>
<p>Go play it! <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: its seriously addictive! no kidding! </p>
<p><strong>p.s</strong>.: my high score (hexagon) is 85 sec, pretty ok, i guess.. hehe..</p>
