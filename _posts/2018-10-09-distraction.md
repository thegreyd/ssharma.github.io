Sam harris on his [podcast episode about death](https://samharris.org/podcasts/the-lessons-of-death/)


`"We are living in the age of smartphone and perpetual distraction. It's amazing to consider that the advice that people like socrates and buddha gave, not to be distracted, about the automacity of life and take some time to pay attention to the most important things. That advice was given at a time when the only distraction was going to the tea shop. Now we live in a world where people are struggling to play less than 6 hours of video games, when video games are so compelling."`

Distraction is the enemy. Training your attention is the goal. The state of [flow](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics-ebook/dp/B000W94FE6) when you focus on something so intently that you lose track of time and your worries about past and future. Choosing something to do, and then doing it with full attention. Even if it's a mundane thing, the act of choosing to do them with all your intent, gives a sweet satisfaction. Nothing well done is wasted. So pay attention to the things you do, do not be distracted.
