Albert Einstein was undeniably one of the greatest physicist of all time. he derived the path breaking equation 'e=mc2' which played an instrumental part in the human understanding of the world. the equation's one of the conclusion or inference, among many others, was that the universe was continuously expanding. This was a possibility that Einstein himself couldn't foresee or perceive. He rejected it with his utmost gut-sensation. He couldn't comprehend his own work. But then several years later Edwin Hubble, another great pioneer in astronomy and physics, proved the same with his detailed observations. this hints us that, the human brain has some limits of immediate imagination. such complexities, many still oblivious to us, never cease to exist or baffle when discovered .

As we continue to acquire knowledge, which is limitless, the mystery increases. human beings favorite past time has been questioning things which we even do know and which congenitally defines us. but you may think before questioning that the answer you seek may not be the one you get, it may be beyond your wildest of realms. so do we stop questioning?(here lies the irony). no, but we may satiate ourselves by heeding that somethings are, better left undefined or inconclusive or, random. you may want to know everything but your conscience may not comprehend it, to believe what your senses cannot conclude. there would always be a speck of doubt in your cloud of reason.

Nature will always manage to confound us, in our quest for the laws that govern everything, restrain us from becoming god. but it is the only way for us to survive, to escape our imminent demise; to reach as further as we can.ï»¿
