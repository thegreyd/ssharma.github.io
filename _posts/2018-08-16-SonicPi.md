SonicPi is a music editor, which lets you write code that generates music. Exciting!

I am someone who knows very little about music theory or playing an instrument. But I know how to code! I feel like the perfect audience for this. It's also aimed at school kids to teach them programming making it fun, interactive and tangible(the opposite of abstract which is how it usually is).

When I looked at the code, it reminded of Ruby. And indeed it is. Ruby is Kewl! I know Ruby \o/

The installation on Elementary was straightforward (since it's supported on Ubuntu). I couldn't get it to run on Fedora 28 on my other system, as I was using an unofficial rpm and there's no official support for it. The Pi in the name is from Raspberry Pi and it's well supported on the platform. 

The editor has tutorial and examples on the bottom half, which is pretty convenient. I got started with the basics today; hoping I can get a cool song in a week. Probably some chip music like chipzel.co.uk or electronic metallica cover?
