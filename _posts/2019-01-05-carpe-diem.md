If you haven't seen the movie Dead Poets society go watch it now. The movie revolves around the non-conformist high school teacher Professor Keating, teaching a class of boys. The central mood of the movie is "Carpe Diem" or "Seize the day". Nietzche would've liked Professor Keating, afterall he's the one who proclaimed "Live dangerously". What makes it so good? It tells a very familiar story. Like all good art almost everyone can identify with it, and like all the really good art it makes us reflect on our own lives, asking us to be better.

"**Conformity is the difficulty in maintaining your own beliefs in the face of others. We have a great need for acceptance but you must trust your beliefs are unique, your own, even though others may think they're odd or unpopular.**" - Professor Keating

Why is the idea of non-conformity so powerful? Because it recognizes the heavy hand of society's conditioning on us. From the moment we are born our indoctrination starts to do THIS, to be THIS. Our destiny is often decided while we are still teenagers. Nobody asks you what you want forget about teaching authentic self-expression, because that's hard work and a vague idea which who knows where it'll take you. You think you hate your parents, but watch yourself do the same things when you become one. It's a tricky problem. 

I'll try to distill it - The problem is, as a parent you want your child to be obedient, cooperative and not aggressive, selfish, impolite or mean. To set them up for success. While in the adult world, success often means being self-aware, direct, assertive, confident, persistent, outspoken. Do you see the flaw? Do you expect a child to magically transform into this amazing adult? Fuck success. That's what a healthy human adult would look like. You should strive to manifest your will on the world. People pleasing will make you miserable and only authentic self-expression can liberate you.

"**You must strive to find your own voice. The longer you wait to begin the less likely you are to find it at all. Thoreau said 'Most men lead lives of quite desperation'. Don't be resigned to that! Breakout!**" - Professor Keating.

The movie shows a heartbreaking but all very real and common father-son relationship. An overly-critical, controlling father and the dutiful son. Men look up to their father, their first role-model. The family revolves around the father, he's THE GOD of your world until you're on your own. If your father doesn't accept you (by that I mean your real self), no wonder you hate yourself. That's where you get the "inner-critic" from, the voice in your head that criticizes you ALL THE TIME. Tyrannical parent(s) fuck you up.

**The longer you wait to begin the less likely you are to find it all**. If you recognize you are not revealing yourself to the world fully, the time to act is now my friend.
