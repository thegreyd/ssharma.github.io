"Know Thyself". The command inscribed above the Temple of Apollo in Delphi. How can you effectively know yourself? What shapes your identity?

## Motivation

I've been reading bits of pieces of psychology for the past couple of weeks. One of the books I read some months ago by a professor of psychoanalysis "[What about me? The struggle for identity in a market based society](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1922070904)". It's a thought provoking book, explaining lucidly how "Identity is ideology".

It's interesting to note [this online article](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/george-monbiot-essential-reading-list/) was where I saw it, and reading the preview piqued my interest at which point I ordered the book. It also led me to other works like East of Eden, and Revolutionary Road; both of which are amazing pieces of literature, imaginatively describing human psychology. Highly recommended.

Identity is the answer to the question "Who am I?".

Sartre, French existential philosopher would tell you identity is:
- Facticity (past & present) - facts about you - what happened to you in the past that made you who you are today.
- Transcendence (future) - the person you want to be.

If we talk Facticity, let's define some obvious facts about an individual.

- Biological Sex - A Homo Sapien can be either male or female. 
    + Nature: We inherit the inherent biases of our biological sex. These relate to our genes, evolved over thousands of years of evolution.
    + Nurture: People treat you based on your biological sex. This is dictated by the immediate culture that you live in.
- Appearance
    + Nature: How you look will be based on your biological parents. Your face, skin color, hair, height etc. 
    + Nurture: People treat you differently based on your features, dictated by the culture.

A child inherits his world view from other people in his environment. This social hierarchy, in order of priority:
+ parents & close family
+ close friends & peers
+ extended family & community
+ culture (state/nation)

You inherit religious and political views from your parents. The economic status that you were brought up in affects you. Do they have conservative views/centrist/progressive/radical views?

Freud suggests that 2 of our outlooks are of utmost important in shaping our identity:
- how we deal with authority (shaped by father)
- how we deal with opposite sex (shaped by mother)

Again you can trace these views in your culture (which influenced your parents). Eastern cultures bend towards family-oriented view, obedience and conformity (see the philosophy of Confucianism). Western cultures bend towards individualism, non-conformity, liberalism. 

You can trace patriarchal views in your culture. Standards of beauty in your culture affect your internal psychology of attraction. Every culture has a history of dogmas like racism, sexism and ideologies like nationalism, fascism, liberalism which influence us. 

It's hard to identify these sublime influences in your thinking. To me they seem natural or rational conclusions that I reached myself. Yuval Harrari explains wonderfully in the book "Sapiens", these are stories that Homo Sapiens believe in. Some stories are useful and some are not. It can be helpful to think that the views and ideas that you hold so dearly in your head are like clothes. You are given a default pair at birth. They are not you; and when they lose their usefulness you can get a new pair.
